In a world where customers are looking for a more personalized shopping experience, automated email flows have <u>never</u> been a more important marketing tool. [**<u>A recent study</u>**](https://www.omnisend.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-email-sms-and-push-report.pdf) **showed that automated emails generated 41% of all email orders, while accounting for only 2% of emails sent in 2023.**  

Privy’s Automations are set to trigger in response to specific behaviors and key points in a shopper’s journey. This allows you to send the *right communication* at the *right moment*, whether they just signed up with you, forgot about items in their cart, or just completed their first purchase. 

When it comes to prioritizing automations that will make a difference in your email strategy, there are four types that truly stand out:

1. <a href="#abandoned-cart-emails" >Abandoned Cart Emails</a>

2. <a href="#welcome-emails" >Welcome Emails</a>

3. <a href="#purchase-follow-up-emails" >Purchase Follow-Up Emails</a>

4. <a href="customer-winback-emails" >Customer Winback Emails</a>

<Note>
  One of the biggest mistakes you can make with Automations is not having them active at all. Make sure these four series are part of your e-commerce strategy. Otherwise, you're simply leaving money on the table.

## Abandoned Cart Emails

Abandoned Cart Emails are one of the most impactful automated series you can activate. By targeting those who came to your site, put something into their cart, and left without completing a purchase, you have the chance to recover the lost sale.

**A good Abandoned Cart Series:**

<Icon icon="sparkles" /> Is clear, branded, and contains multiple call-to-actions leading to the recipient's cart.

<Icon icon="cart-shopping" /> Uses a [Cart Summary](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/automations/abandoned-cart-email#customize-your-templates:~:text=By%20default%2C%20your%20templates%20will%20include%20a%20Cart%20Summary%2C%20which%20will%20reveal%20each%20product%20in%20your%20customer%E2%80%99s%20cart%2C%20as%20well%20as%20Call%2DTo%2DActions%20leading%20directly%20to%20your%20customer%E2%80%99s%20cart%20URL.) content block to reveal what the recipient left behind.

<Icon icon="percent" /> Incentivizes your recipient to complete their purchase.

### Examples

[Club Huey](https://clubhuey.com/) does a great job of this on their abandoned cart emails, which includes an incentive to bring them back to their cart. They also show the customer the item that they left behind in their cart, alongside a clear call-to-action:

## Welcome Emails

You only have one chance at a first impression, and when someone first signs up for your list, a [Welcome series](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/automations/welcome-email) is the perfect opportunity to introduce your products, shop, and mission. People buy from people, and by establishing trust and a relationship with your audience early on, they’ll be more likely to purchase from you in the future.&#x20;

**A good Welcome Series:**

<Icon icon="hand-holding-heart" /> Gets personal and tells your brand's story and mission.

<Icon icon="trophy-star" /> Shines a spotlight on your best sellers + brand initiatives.

<Icon icon="stars" /> Includes social proof that builds trust and motivates purchases.

### Examples

[Capabunga](http://capabunga.com/) has a set up 3 emails where they introduce themselves, showcase their bestsellers, followed by glowing reviews to help build trust.

## Purchase Follow-Up Emails

The journey doesn’t end when someone completes their first purchase with you! No one wants to feel like just a transaction, and if you’re only sending out the basic order and shipping confirmation emails, you’re missing out on a big opportunity to make your customers feel special and appreciated.

**Some good Purchase Follow-Up ideas include:**

<Icon icon="face-smile-hearts" /> A personal thank you note from the founder.

<Icon icon="soap" /> Care instructions so that they know how to look after their purchase.

<Icon icon="leaf-heart" /> Sustainable or philanthropic initiatives that their purchase contributed to.

<Icon icon="arrows-rotate-reverse" /> A restock reminder, or a cross sell to promote other products.

### Examples

[TePe Oral Health Care](https://www.tepeusa.com/) sends out targeted post-purchase emails based on the product the shopper purchased, providing a custom instructional guide on how to best use the product.&#x20;

## Customer Winback Emails

Did you know that repeat customers created as a result of your actions are 9x more likely to convert, spend 3x your average order value, and are 20% more profitable for your business? That is why customer retention is so important and having an active [Customer Winback series](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/automations/customer-winback) is crucial.

**A good Customer Winback series:**

<Icon icon="face-smile-hearts" /> Makes your customer feel noticed and appreciated by [using their first name](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/content/personalization-tags#using-merge-tags).

<Icon icon="timer" /> Creates urgency around an incentive to use on their next order.

<Icon icon="hand-wave" /> Is positive and friendly (i.e., "We missed you!"), rather than a sales pitch or guilt trip.

### Examples

[Blooms of Hawaii](https://www.bloomsofhawaii.com/) uses a friendly subject line, addresses their customer by their first time, and reminds them of their limited-time incentive in their Winback Series:
