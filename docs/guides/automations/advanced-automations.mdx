You've got your automations all set up, and now you want to take them to the next level. Adding more advanced settings to your automations gives you even more control over the audience you're sending too, which allows you to use more tailored messaging.

## Abandoned Cart Emails

### Settings

What settings should I consider to level up my Abandoned Cart strategy?

1. **Cart Value:** You can set a minimum and/or maximum cart value for your series. This would restrict these emails from triggering unless the shopper's cart value meets this criteria.

2. **Products/Collections:** You can select collection(s) or product(s) for your series. This would restrict these emails from triggering unless the shopper's cart contains these items.

### Advanced Content Ideas

Below are some possible content ideas that could make your Abandoned Cart Series more pointed and effective for your audience, based on the advanced targeting you selected:

* **Tiered discounts:** Consider a tiered abandoned cart strategy, where you offer a certain discount to "low value" carts and another discount to "high value" carts. For example, maybe carts under $75 get 10% off, but carts over $75 get $10 off.

* **Free shipping:** Target carts over your store's free shipping threshold and emphasize that their cart qualifies for free shipping.

* **Nice-to-know information:** If you have any certain products or collections that might have great social proof or special information that could motivate a purchase, target these carts and feature this content.

* **Customization options:** If you offer any personalization for certain products (i.e., engraving, monograms, custom colors, gift wrapping), target those carts and highlight these services!

## Purchase Follow-Up Emails

### Settings

What settings should I consider to level up my post-purchase strategy?

1. **Customer action:** Trigger emails based on a customer placing an order vs. receiving the order.

2. **Order Count:** You can trigger a series for someone's first order, a repeat order, or leave it open-ended to any number of orders.

3. **Order Value:** You can set a minimum and/or maximum order value for this series. This would restrict this series from triggering unless the customer's subtotal met this criteria.

4. **Products/Collections:** You can select collection(s) or product(s) for your series. This would restrict these emails from triggering unless the customer's order contains these items.

### Advanced Content Ideas

Below are some possible content ideas that can level up your post-purchase experience, leaving shoppers feeling like they're more than just an order number to you.

* **Ask for feedback:** If you don't already use a third party review app, trigger a Purchase Follow-Up email asking customers for a review 30 days post-purchase.

* **New customer discount:** Strike while the iron is hot. Use the "First Order" setting under *Order Count* and offer a coupon for new customers to use on their next purchase with you!

* **High value = high reward:** Keep your high value customers coming back for more. Use the minimum order value setting and send a personal thank you note from the founder. Include a discount to use on their next big order.

* **Care instructions:** Do any of your products/collections require special care or assembly? Let your customers know how to get the most of their purchase.

* **Cross sell:** Would a customer benefit from pairing their recent purchase with another product? Let them know a couple weeks after they place their order. Offer a small incentive to encourage repeat buying.

## Things to consider

The key to advanced automations is to identify the moments when you know extra details about your customers. Once you know more about them, use that information to better inform your own content, thus focusing your automation strategy.

You should also be mindful about your own brand and how it operates so that you can set up automations that feel natural and personal to your audience:

* How long does it typically take for your orders to ship/deliver to customers?

* How long do your products last?

* What's your average order value?

This information will help you determine the **timing** and **incentives** to use in your automations. For example, here's what you want to avoid:

<Icon icon="circle-xmark" /> Pushing customers to "restock" too soon (i.e., a skincare company might push their next sale before a home improvement store would).
