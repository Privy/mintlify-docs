Not sure where to start with segmenting your audience? This is the right guide for you.

## What is segmentation?

Segmentation is the division of contacts into smaller groups (segments) based on the criteria you choose. Your criteria can be based on contacts' Shopping Activity, Website Behavior, Contact Attributes, Email Engagement, or a combination of these categories!

### Why should you use segments?

Some benefits to segmenting your emails include...

<Icon icon="inbox" /> Improved inbox placement and healthy deliverability.

<Icon icon="hand-wave" /> Increased engagement (open rates, click-through rates).

Segmentation enables you to send highly personalized, relevant content to your customers and, therefore, builds a stronger engagement track record with your sending domain and helps you avoid inbox spam filters.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Engaged Contacts" description="Mailable contacts who have opened or clicked at least one email within the last 90 days." defaultOpen={false}>
    **ü§© These are your most interested + loyal subscribers.** You can treat them like your VIPs and reward them with content like early access emails or sneak peeks at new products. You can also reserve your newsletter content such as style guides, customer spotlights, or exciting behind-the-scenes looks at your brand.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unengaged Contacts" description="Mailable contacts who have not opened or clicked any email within the last 90 days." defaultOpen={false}>
    **ü•∂ These contacts have become a bit cold.** Attempt to re-engage them with limited-time offers or "in case you missed it" emails, catching them up on the biggest news with your brand!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Current Customers" description="Mailable contacts who have placed at least one order with your store." defaultOpen={false}>
    **üõçÔ∏è These are customers you've already won over (at least once).** Tap into this ‚Äî existing customers are 9x more likely to convert. Remind them of your best sellers and tease your upcoming deals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Potential Customers" description="Mailable contacts who have never placed an order with your store." defaultOpen={false}>
    ü§î **These contacts are still thinking it over...** There are a number of reasons why subscribers might not have purchased yet:

    * **Still in the discovery phase:** focus on what problem(s) your product solves and make it obvious in your Subject Line.

    * **On a budget:** offer free shipping or an unbelievable deal (make sure you tap into the fact that it'd be their first purchase!)

    * **Not convinced:** send potential customers social proof like customer testimonials, reviews, press, awards, certifications, brand initiatives, or share your small business' journey to win them over.
