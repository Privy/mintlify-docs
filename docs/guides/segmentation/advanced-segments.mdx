As you grow your list, your contacts will interact with your brand in different ways. With every interaction, you’ll gather more insights about who these contacts are and what they’re interested in. The more insights you have, the more creative you can get with segments. Custom segments enable you to create more personalized content which will deliver higher engagement metrics and drive more conversions.

This article will walk you through some common + effective advanced segmentation strategies to help you learn how to use Privy to get the right message to the right people!

We’ll show you how to build Custom Segments that will:

1. <a href="#reward-high-value-customers">Reward high-value customers</a>

2. <a href="#target-frequent-buyers">Target frequent buyers</a>

3. <a href="#re-target-campaigns">Re-target campaigns</a>

4. <a href="#incentivize-lapsed-customers">Incentivize lapsed customers</a>

## Reward High-Value Customers

High-value customers have supported your business on a different level than the rest of your subscribers — you might see a customer who’s given you over $500 differently than one who’s given you $25, and you want these high-value customers to stick around.

Use the **Lifetime Spend** category when creating a new Custom Segment. Choose **is greater than** from the following dropdown and enter a value.



<Tip>
  Every business will have a different idea of what a high-value customer is! When picking a Lifetime Spend value, consider your average order value + account for any customers who have bought from you more than once.

* Behind-the-scenes looks at new products or exciting announcements

* Exclusive early access to drops

* Double points for your rewards programs

* Ask for feedback / testimonials / customer features

## Target Frequent Buyers

One of the easiest ways to determine if someone is truly invested in your brand is by looking at their order count. Not only are these contacts opening your emails, but they’re coming back again and again to support your brand.

Use the **Order count** category when building a new Custom Segment. A great place to start would be an Order count greater than 2, but you can always customize this to fit your business!



<Icon icon="sparkles" /> **Content Ideas:**

* Ask these customers what to make next!

* Ask these customers for testimonials

* Offer free shipping to reward their loyalty

## Re-target Campaigns

If you want to try and re-engage contacts, re-target a campaign, or extend a sale but you want to exclude those who already showed interest, you can build a segment based on whether or not someone opened and/or clicked on an email.

Use the **Did not open** category when building a Custom Segment, choose **a campaign** from the following dropdown menu, and then select the campaign(s) you want to focus on.



<Tip>
  This strategy is best used around your bigger sales and announcements — it's not recommended to target unengaged contacts after every single email.
</Tip>

* “In case you missed it” emails

* Extend your sale for 24 hours

* “Last chance” emails

## Incentivize Lapsed Customers

Hopefully, you have a [Customer Winback Email](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/automations/customer-winback) live in your account so that you can do this automatically! However, there might be special instances where you really want to target customers who have not ordered in a significant amount of time — specifically, around your biggest sale(s) of the year.

Use the **Last order** category when building a Custom Segment. Choose a date — any contacts with orders from *before* this date will fall into this segment.



<Tip>
  You can also pair this category with **Did not open** an email **in the last X days** in an effort to re-engage a narrower audience of colder contacts.
</Tip>

* “Don’t miss our last/biggest sale of the year”

* Offer a free gift with purchase

* Get personal and use their name in the subject line / content
