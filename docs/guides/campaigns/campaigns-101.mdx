Regularly sending campaigns your audience is crucial for staying relevant, engaging with potential customers, driving consistent revenue, and maintaining a healthy deliverability. But whether you're brand new to sending email campaigns, or you've been at it for years, you might run into the following common questions:

1. <a href="#sending-cadence">How often should I be emailing my list?</a>

2. <a href="#sending-to-all-contacts-vs-segments">How often should I be segmenting my campaigns?</a>

3. <a href="#content">What type of content should I be sending?</a>

4. <a href="#templates">What's the best template to use?</a>

## Sending Cadence

It's very important to be cognizant of what your brand's sending cadence + frequency will be â€” you don't want to bother your subscribers, but you also don't want to fade into the background of peoples' inboxes.

**Here are 3 rules for choosing a sending cadence:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Send at least one campaign a month." defaultOpen={false}>
    A huge reason that businesses send campaigns is to stay relevant and visible. Sending at least one campaign a month lets your subscribers know your business is active and keeps you top of mind. Neglecting to engage with your audience will impact the return you see in email because a subscriber will not purchase from you if they forget you're around.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Avoid taking large gaps in sending." defaultOpen={false}>
    Deliverability is another major player in choosing your email cadence. Taking large gaps in sending for months at a time puts your domain at risk for dangerous levels of spam complaints and a diminished track record of engagement once you start sending again; inbox providers may start filtering your emails to spam if they start detecting this.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Choose a sending cadence that you know you can be consistent with." defaultOpen={false}>
    Don't bite off more than you can chew! Avoid sending 3x a week if there's a risk that you won't have time to keep it up. Choose a cadence that feels realistic to your bandwidth and how your business operates so that you can set proper expectations with your audience.

<Tip>
  The most important thing is to be **consistent** so that your audience knows what to expect from your brand's marketing.

**Another important thing to consider:** if you're segmenting your emails, it's likely that not every single contact is receiving every single email you send. That being said, if you're being intentional with your messaging, you don't need to worry about bothering your list with too many emails.

## Sending to All Contacts vs Segments

Let's face it: not every email that you send is meant for every contact on your list. Every contact is a human being at a different point in their customer journey with you. You'll have people who just signed up 3 days ago, and people whose last purchase was 1 year ago. If you want your campaigns to be impactful, this is why you need to use segments more often!

There's no magic formula or ratio for how many emails should be sent to All Contacts vs. Custom Segments, but you should be trying to send to segments as much as you can, especially because segmentation makes content creation easier, because you know exactly who you're speaking to.

**Campaigns that should be sent to All Contacts:**

* Big sale announcements (Black Friday, holidays, birthday sales...)

* Major brand updates (rebrands, new initiatives, new products...)

* Newsletter content (recipes, style guides, press...)

**Campaigns that should be sent to Segments:**

This depends on the segments you use for your business, but here's some ideas:

* **Engaged Contacts / VIP segments:** VIP early access, sneak peeks, or teaser emails

* **Potential Customers:** limited-time incentives to place their first order

* **By Purchase History:** product spotlights, cross sell content
