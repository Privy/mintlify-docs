Delivering exciting content to your audience is important; you want your list to look forward to each message you send\! One of the easiest ways to come up with timely, relevant content is by finding a reason to celebrate. This can be around major holidays, meaningful dates for your brand, and/or more obscure national days. This article will walk you through each of these types of celebrations and why they're important to leverage for your business.

## Major Holidays

When you think of the word "holiday", the first ones that come to mind might be the big ones: Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, and so on. Many major holidays such as these are crucial for e-commerce businesses; most brands are running deals around these times of year, so there's a lot of competition in peoples' inboxes.

Most holidays present an opportunity to shop: for gifts, for a new season, for hosting the perfect get-together — by sending a campaign to your list, you're reminding your customers that you're a great option for whatever holiday needs they might have.

<Tip>
  It's important to plan ahead so that customers can receive their item(s) in time for the holiday they're shopping for (i.e., start sending Valentine's Day emails at the end of January).

## Brand Milestones

You don’t need to limit your celebrations to major holidays. As a small business, you have a lot to celebrate, and your audience will look forward to supporting you around these times\! You can run campaigns around:

- Your brand’s birthday
- Good press (getting on Shark Tank, being featured in a local magazine)
- Your founder’s birthday
- Reaching a certain number of 5-star reviews for a product

The best part about sending campaigns around brand milestones is that they’re completely unique to your business — it’s easy to be original, and there’s likely a lot less competition in people’s inboxes unlike Black Friday.

## National Days

If you’re looking for some more fun content inspiration that might resonate with your brand and audience, check out resources such as this [2025 Celebrations Calendar](https://www.calendarr.com/united-states/observances-2025/) — you’d be surprised at how many days/weeks are dedicated to celebrating random things, such as “National Pizza Day”, "National Pen Pal Day", or “National Physician’s Week”\!

Not every celebration is going to align with your brand, but you might find one or two that does. Have fun and send some playful campaigns around these days/weeks and use them as an excuse to run a flash sale and/or educational campaign around your products.
