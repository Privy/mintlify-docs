## What is a Mini Quiz?

A Mini Quiz is an element that you can add to your Privy sign up displays; it's a sleek way to make your displays more interactive and to gather invaluable information from your contacts at sign up. They tend to be most effective when used as the first step in a sign up display, followed by collecting email and/or phone number. The Mini Quiz journey doesn’t stop at sign up either — you can put this information to work by using it to segment your list and send personalized messaging to your audience!

### Use Cases

The nice thing about Mini Quizzes is that they can fit a variety of use cases, depending on your brand, what you sell, and who you’re selling to. Here’s some of our favorite ways that Mini Quizzes can be used:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Shopping Preferences" defaultOpen={false} icon="bag-shopping">
    Ask your shoppers what collection(s) or theme(s) they’re most interested in so that you can make personalized product recommendations!&#x20;



    Here's some examples:

    * Men’s, Women’s, or both

    * Silver or gold

    * Scent type
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer Attributes" defaultOpen={false} icon="user">
    Ask your shoppers a question about who they are so you know what type of content would be best suited for them.



    Here's some examples:

    * Professional or student

    * Age range (18-24, 25-34, etc...)

    * Zodiac sign
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Just for fun!" defaultOpen={false} icon="sparkles">
    Include a lighthearted quiz that you can use for fun campaign content and Subject Lines in the future!

    * Breakfast, lunch, or dinner? (for brands in the food industry)

    * Who are you rooting for in the Super Bowl?

    * Favorite season (for clothing brands)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Add a Mini Quiz to your display

Privy has a few different Templates that include mini quizzes for you to customize. You can choose one of these templates, or add a mini quiz to an existing draft or display.

To add a mini quiz to a display:

* Head to Convert > All Displays.

* Select an existing display, or **Create New Display**.

* Click **Add Step** at the bottom of the display builder and select **Mini Quiz** from the menu.

<Tip>
  Use the **Match Styles** functionality to copy over the layout, colors, images, fonts, and styles from your existing step(s) to save time!
</Tip>

Make sure that you have your Mini Quiz step in the correct place. If you need to reorder the steps of your display, simply drag and drop your steps as shown below:

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="mini-quiz-step" src="/images/strategy-guides/miniquiz-reorder-step.mp4" />

## Customize your Mini Quiz

To edit your Mini Quiz, click directly on your Mini Quiz element. All of its settings will appear on the right side of the editor.

Under the **Mini Quiz** settings, you will be able to specify:

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="customize-mini-quiz" src="/images/strategy-guides/miniquiz-options.mp4" />

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Property Name" defaultOpen={false}>
    This will be the name of your Custom Field, which will appear in your contact’s profile, in contact CSV exports, and will be mapped to third party providers (if you’re syncing to a Linked Account).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage Options" defaultOpen={false}>
    These are the options that will appear on your sign up display. Upon selecting an option, this value will appear as an Attribute in your contact’s profile. You can create Custom Segments using this Custom Field value (which we will cover below).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="On-Click Action" defaultOpen={false}>
    This specifies what happens when an option is clicked. This is set to “Transition to: next display” by default. This means selecting an option will seamlessly move the sign up to the next step.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

You’ll also be able to customize the quiz’s style, text appearance, and block padding in the tabs on the right side of the editor as well. Make sure you **Save** your changes.

Once you’re happy with your display’s design and you’ve adjusted its [settings & targeting](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/displays/settings-overview), you can select **Activate** and your display will be live:

## Using your Mini Quiz data

Once you’ve launched a display with a Mini Quiz and have started collecting answers from your sign ups, you can start building your Custom Segment(s).

To build a segment with your Mini Quiz custom fields:

* Head to Contacts > Segments and click **Create Segment** in the upper right.

* Give your segment a name.

* Go to choose your category for the segment, and select **Custom Field** from the dropdown menu.

* In the following dropdown, search for and select the Property Name that you chose for your Mini Quiz.

* Select “text” and “begins with” from the following dropdowns.

* Finally, type in the value of the Option you’d like to segment by.

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="mini-quiz-segment" src="/images/strategy-guides/miniquiz-create-segment.mp4" />

Add any other condition(s) if desired, then click **Create** to make your segment!

<Warning>
  **Note:** Custom Fields are case sensitive, so make sure that the value you’re using for your new segment matches exactly how it appears in your display.
</Warning>

This segment will be dynamic, which means that new contacts will be added automatically as they sign up and meet the conditions you set.

### Best Practices

Depending on your use case, it may be smart to add a **Purchase History** condition to your segment to pair with your Mini Quiz data. *For example, if you’re asking whether they prefer Gold or Silver jewelry, you might want to create a segment of people who answered “Gold” on your Mini Quiz along with anyone who has purchased from your Gold collections before.*

<Tip>
  If you want your segment to include anyone with *either* the Mini Quiz custom field *or* the Purchase History, remember to use **Match Any** instead of Match All when building your segment.

## Engaging with your Mini Quiz segment

The information you collect through your Mini Quiz can be invaluable in targeting your messaging. The more you know about your audience, the more equipped you are to send them content that you know they’ll find interesting. This can work wonders for your engagement metrics, and it increases the likelihood that you’ll secure an order.

<Icon icon="lightbulb-on" /> **Consider targeting your Mini Quiz segment(s) with the following campaigns:**

* New product launches that align with their preferences

* Promotions on specific items that align with their preferences

* Newsletter / lifestyle content that speaks to who they are

* Product spotlights that align with their preferences

* Super exclusive flash deals

...and be sure to use specific language that resonates with the information you've collected from them!
