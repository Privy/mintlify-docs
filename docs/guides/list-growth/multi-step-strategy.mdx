## What is a Multi Step display?

While your standard sign up display has one step and one single form for a visitor to submit, a Multi Step display will have more than one step for a visitor to complete in order to submit a sign up; Multi Step displays can be used in a variety of ways, and they’re great for when you want to collect a lot of information without overwhelming your visitors! 

This guide will walk you through the most common use cases and how you can build them in your dashboard.

## Use Cases + Examples

Multi Step displays are generally effective when you want to collect more information than just an email address. Below are some ideas and examples of how you can use multiple steps in one display.

### Collecting Email + SMS Contacts

The most effective way to grow your SMS list without sacrificing your email list growth is by using a Multi Step display. Asking for email and SMS on one form up front can feel overwhelming at first. Additionally, SMS is an extremely intimate channel — the truth is, not everyone wants to sign up for it! This strategy is perfect if you want a more approachable, bite-sized approach to asking for SMS consent.

<Note>
  In order to collect SMS contacts, you must have either an active Growth Plan subscription at Privy, or you need to be syncing sign ups to a [Linked Account](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/integrations/overview-integrations#sms-providers) that supports SMS.

Privy has multiple templates for collecting both Email + SMS consent. You can start from one of our Multi Step Templates, or follow the instructions below:

To add a step collecting Phone Number / SMS:

* Head to Convert > All Displays.

* Select an existing display, or click 

  **Create New Display**.

* In the editor, click **Add Step** at the bottom of your screen.

* Select **Phone Collection** from the menu.

Customize the appearance as needed and make sure your steps are in the correct order (you can drag and drop them to reorder, if needed). For this strategy, it’s recommended that you ask for email first, then SMS second. **Save** your changes.

<Tip>
  Use the **Match Styles** functionality to copy over the layout, colors, images, fonts, and styles from your existing step(s) to save time!
</Tip>

If you want the phone number step to be optional, select the phone form field element on your display and uncheck the “Required” checkbox in the settings on the right:

### Collecting Custom Fields

You can collect custom fields on your displays by adding a Mini Quiz, Checkboxes, or Radio Buttons. Collecting custom fields can help you gather helpful insights, such as shopping preferences, that you can use to build segments with in the future. More often than not, these are most effective when used on their own dedicated step so that they’re the star of the show!

To add a Mini Quiz, Checkbox, or Radio Button to your display:

* Head to Convert > All Displays.

* Select an existing display, or 

  **Create New Display**.

* Click **Add Step** at the bottom of the display builder and select either **Mini Quiz**, **Checkbox**, or **Radio Button** from the menu.

### Using a Micro-decision

A micro-decision is a strategy which prompts the visitor to select whether or not they want to proceed with signing up for your offer. Instead of immediately asking for their email and phone number, the first thing they’d see is a screen asking if they want to sign up for a discount on their first order; they can accept the offer and be taken to the next step, or decline and close the display.

To add a micro-decision to your display:

* Head to Convert > All Displays.

* Select an existing display, or 

  **Create New Display**.

* Click **Add Step** at the bottom of the display builder and select **Blank Step**.

* Add 1 Text Box and 2 Buttons.

  * Select your first button and edit the on-click action to **Transition to: next display.** Edit the text to reflect a visitor accepting your offer.

  * Select your second button and edit the on-click action to **Close Display.** Edit the text to reflect a visitor declining the offer.

  Quickly copy over your font and button styles from your other steps by clicking on your display and selecting the **Match Styles** functionality.
