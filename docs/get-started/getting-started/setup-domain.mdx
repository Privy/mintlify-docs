## Why is domain setup important?

Proper domain setup ensures:
- Accurate tracking of visitor behavior
- Correct attribution of conversions
- Seamless integration between Privy and your website
- Enhanced security for your customers

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A Privy account
- Access to your domain's DNS settings (usually through your domain registrar or hosting provider)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Log into your Privy account

- Go to the Privy website and log in to your account
- Navigate to 'Settings' in the main menu

### 2. Access Domain Settings

- In the Settings menu, find and click on 'Domain Settings'
- You should see a section for 'CNAME Record'

### 3. Copy your unique CNAME record

- In the Domain Settings, you'll find your unique CNAME record
- It will look something like this: `abcd1234.privy.com`
- Copy this record - you'll need it for the next step

### 4. Access your domain's DNS settings

- Log into your domain registrar or hosting provider's website
- Find the section for managing DNS records
- This might be called 'DNS Management', 'Name Server Management', or something similar

### 5. Add the CNAME record

- In your DNS management area, look for an option to add a new record
- Select 'CNAME' as the record type
- For the 'Host' or 'Name' field, enter: `_privy`
- For the 'Value' or 'Points to' field, paste the CNAME record you copied from Privy
- Save the new record

### 6. Verify the setup

- Return to your Privy account
- In the Domain Settings, look for a 'Verify' or 'Check Setup' button
- Click this button to have Privy confirm that the CNAME record is correctly set up

### 7. Wait for propagation

- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate across the internet
- However, it often happens much faster, sometimes within a few minutes to a few hours

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with your domain setup:

1. Double-check that you've entered the CNAME record correctly
2. Ensure you've used `_privy` as the host name
3. Wait at least 24 hours before assuming there's a problem, as DNS propagation can take time
4. If issues persist, contact your domain registrar to ensure there are no conflicts with existing records

## Additional Notes

- Some domain providers may require a trailing dot (.) at the end of the CNAME value. If you're unsure, check with your provider's documentation or support.
- If you're using Cloudflare or another CDN, make sure that CNAME flattening is disabled for this record.

## Getting Help

If you're still having trouble after following these steps:

1. Check Privy's knowledge base for additional troubleshooting tips
2. Contact Privy support through the chat widget in your dashboard
3. Email support@privy.com with details of the issue you're experiencing

Remember, correct domain setup is crucial for Privy's functionality. Taking the time to set this up properly will ensure you get the most out of the platform.
