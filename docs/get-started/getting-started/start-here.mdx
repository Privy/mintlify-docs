## 5. Collect email and SMS contacts

Start growing your subscriber list with Privy Convert. Choose from a variety of templates with baked-in best practices, customize it to fit your brand, and activate on your site to start seeing results fast!

## 6. Activate an automation

Automations are emails and texts that are triggered by meaningful actions taken by your contacts, such as abandoning a cart or placing an order. These emails and texts are integral to your marketing strategy because they allow you to send personalized content to your audience without ever lifting a finger.

To get started, head to **Automations** and click "New automation" in the upper righthand corner. Choose which kind you want to create, and start customizing your templates and settings!
