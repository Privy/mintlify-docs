To sync the contacts captured by your Privy displays to your Postscript account, you must first integrate the two accounts, then add sync rules to each of your compatible displays. 

## Setting up the integration

To link your Privy account with your Postscript account:

* Click on your business name in the upper right corner of your dashboard and select the **Integrations** option from the dropdown menu. 

* Select **Postscript** from the *Available Integrations* section of this page. 

* Enter your email address and API Token in the prompt, then select **Link Account**.

## Create a sign up display

For the proper information to sync to Postscript so that you can send contacts text messages, a display must include the **phone** field and a **consent disclaimer** with the following language: 

*"I agree to receive recurring automated marketing text messages (e.g., cart reminders) at the phone number provided. Consent is not a condition to purchase. Msg & data rates may apply. Msg frequency varies. Reply HELP for help and STOP to cancel. View our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy."* 

Please link the "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" components to your versions of those documents. Information on updating your documents with the proper language for an SMS marketing program is available from Postscript in these help articles:

* [Update Your Terms of Service](https://help.postscript.io/hc/en-us/articles/1260804633430-Update-Your-Terms-of-Service) & [Update Your Privacy Policy](https://help.postscript.io/hc/en-us/articles/1260804685709-Update-Your-Privacy-Policy)

The complete display should look something like this: 

<img height="200" src="/images/integrations/postscript-display-example.png" />

## Add a sync rule to your display

To add an sync rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to Postscript:

* Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**. 

* Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to **Settings** in your display builder.

* Click to expand **Advanced Settings**. Scroll down and click on the **Sync Integrations** card.

* Click "Add Integration" and select **Postscript** from the dropdown menu. Select your keyword, and **Save**.

This display's signups will now sync to the selected keyword automated flow in Postscript!

<Warning>
  Sync rules must be set for each individual display.

1. Click on your business name in the upper right corner of your Privy Dashboard. Select **Integrations** from the menu that appears.
