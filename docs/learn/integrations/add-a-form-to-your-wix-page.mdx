If you're already using Privy's displays to grow your contact list, you should also consider replacing any sign up forms in the body content of your Wix store with one from Privy. This replacement ensures that all your contacts will sync with your Privy account (wherever they sign up).

**Before you begin...**

<Icon icon="check" /> The Privy code must already be [installed on your Wix site](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/109-install-privy-on-wix). 

<Icon icon="check" /> You must use our **Classic Designer** to build any embedded forms.

## Configuration

The embed process depends on [the editor you've chosen](https://support.wix.com/en/article/adi-moving-from-adi-to-the-editor) to manage your Wix site. If you use the Wix ADI editor, follow the steps below. If you use the Wix Editor, jump to those steps instead. 

### ADI Editor

Once you've [created](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/95-create-an-embedded-form) your Privy form, include it in your ADI Wix content by following these steps: 

* In Privy, navigate to the [Convert](https://dashboard.privy.com/campaigns) dashboard.

* Locate and select the desired embedded form campaign and open the **Create** section.

* Click the **Get Embedded Code** button on the *Embedded Form Design* card.

* Copy the ID shown next to the "data-campaign" tag in the HTML Code. Incorporate it into the URL listed below. Make sure to replace the bolded campaign ID portion.

Copy the customized form permalink, as you'll need it in Wix momentarily. 

* In Wix, select **Site Actions** > **Edit Site** from your site's dashboard.

* In the ADI Editor, navigate to the desired page and select **Add** > **Section to Page** from the toolbar. 

* Select **HTML Embed** from the sidebar, add it to the page, and then move it to the desired location on the page. 

* Select the **Settings** button next to the *HTML* header in the sidebar to open the section HTML settings. 

* Select the **Website** embed type and then paste the permalink into the form you created earlier in the **Paste it here...** field. 

* Click somewhere else on the sidebar or page, and your Privy form should appear. Customize the rest of the section, such as removing any extra default text, to make sure the form is presented appropriately before ultimately previewing and publishing the changes.

* Click and drag the element to the desired location on your page, and then select the **Enter Code** option to open the element's settings. 

* Select the **Website Address** option from the prompt and paste the form permalink you created into the **HTTPS-only...** field. 

* Click the **Apply** button, and your Privy form should appear. Move and resize the element to ensure the form is presented appropriately before previewing and publishing the changes.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you're encountering issues with your embedded forms on Wix, please attempt the following:

### Disable reCAPTCHA

To disable the reCAPTCHA for your Privy forms: 

* Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your *Business Settings*. 

* Scroll down and locate the *Invisible reCAPTCHA* section. 

* Disable the **Enable Invisible reCAPTCHA** checkbox. 

* Click the **Save** button.

<img height="200" src="/images/integrations/edit-recaptcha.png" />

​If this doesn't correct the issue, please contact support via [email](mailto:support@privy.com) or chat.

<Note>
  **Note**: When reCAPTCHA is disabled via your account settings, Privy effectively vouches for your registration process and will attempt to waive all reCAPTCHA requirements. However, if behavioral analysis suspects that a user may be a bot or that spam activities are taking place, reCAPTCHA can still fire in the background. This aspect of reCAPTCHA cannot be disabled as it is currently one of the best ways to protect Privy merchants from suspicious or abusive activity.
