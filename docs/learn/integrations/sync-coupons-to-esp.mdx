Syncing a contact's coupon information to an external email service provider (ESP) allows you to gauge the contact's recent activities more easily and craft personalized messaging around their sign up activity and/or the coupon they've received. 

**Before you begin:**

<Icon icon="check" /> Make sure you're properly connected with one of our supported ESP integrations. [Find all supported integrations and their set-up instructions here.](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/integrations/overview-integrations)

## Add a Profile Attribute

Profile Attributes are hidden fields that can be used to pass values into a contact's record without requiring the contact to fill in that information on the display's form.

In this case, you will want to add the Coupon Profile Attribute, which is associated with the code presented to a contact after they sign up via a display. To add this hidden field to a display: 

* Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays** via the main navigation.  

* Select an existing display, or create a new display that includes a form. 

* In the **Settings** step of the display builder, click to **Show Advanced Settings**. Scroll to click on the **Profile Attributes** card. 

* Select the **Collect New Attribute** button.

* Select the **Save** option.

The display will now collect and store the coupon code associated with a contact's sign up event on this display.

## Map the field to your provider

Since you are using an external service to send messages or store contact information, it is important to map the hidden fields to that service. The mapping(s) ensure that all the data you collect in your form and associated with your contacts appears in your database in the right spot. *The mapping(s) should be done before you launch your display.* 

The easiest way to ensure compatibility is to configure your fields so that they share the same label and the same internal name across each platform. In this case, you should create a field/property that uses **`coupon_code`** as its internal value.

## Add a sync rule to your display

Once you've added your Profile Attribute + ensured that the field will map correctly to your ESP, you need to ensure that you are syncing your sign ups to said ESP. To accomplish this, add a sync rule to your display:

1. Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**.

2. Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. 

3. Click to expand **Advanced Settings** at the bottom left of the page. Scroll to the **Sync Integrations** section.&#x20;

4. Select your ESP from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**.

Your coupon code will now be stored in Privy and will sync over to your email service provider for all sign ups moving forward!

<Warning>
  **Note:** These settings must be set for each display individually. Each signup will attempt to overwrite any previously synced information. The historical values may be reviewable in your external provider; however, this functionality varies by platform.
