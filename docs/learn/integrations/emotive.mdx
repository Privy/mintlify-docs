All set\! Emotive should now appear as a linked account in the _Authorized Accounts_ section.

<Accordion title="Need help finding your Personal Access Token in Emotive?" icon="circle-question">
  A Personal Access Token is also known as an "API Key" in Emotive. Your API Keys can be found by heading to **List Growth \> Integrations** on the left side of your Emotive dashboard.

  If you have an existing API Key, you can locate it on this page, then copy & paste it into the Personal Access Token field in Privy.

  If you need to create a new API Key, you can do so by following these instructions:

  - If you're creating your very first API Key, select **Start Here** in the middle of the screen. If you have existing API Keys but you'd like to create a new one, click **Add New** in the upper right.
  - Customize your _Signup Flow Name _on the following screen.
  - Select your **Welcome Message** from the dropdown at the bottom of the page.
  - Click **Next** once you're ready, and copy your new API Key.
</Accordion>

## Add a sync rule to your displays

To add a sync rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to Emotive:

1. Navigate to **Convert** \> **All Displays**.
2. Select the display you’d like to sync and navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. 
3. Click to expand **Advanced Settings** at the bottom left of the page. Scroll to the **Sync Integrations** section.
4. Select **Emotive** from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**.
