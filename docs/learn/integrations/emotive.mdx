To sync the contacts captured by your Privy displays into your Emotive account, you will first need to integrate the two accounts, then set up sync rules on each of your displays.

## Features of the integration

The Privy \<\> Emotive integration allows you to sync SMS contacts collected via Privy Display, and:

- Choose which Welcome Flow they should enter after signup
- Sync the master or unique coupon code generated at signup
- Sync custom properties collected at time of signup (via [Mini Quiz, Radio Button, or Checkboxes](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/displays/form-fields-and-elements#form-fields))

## Setting up the integration

To link your Privy account with your Emotive account:

1. Click on your business name in the upper right corner of your dashboard. Select the **Integrations** option from the dropdown menu.
2. Select **Emotive** from the list of _Available Integrations._
3. Enter your email address and your Personal Access Token from Emotive, then click **Link Account**.

  A Personal Access Token is also known as an "API Key" in Emotive. Your API Keys can be found by heading to **List Growth \> Integrations** on the left side of your Emotive dashboard.

  If you have an existing API Key, you can locate it on this page, then copy & paste it into the Personal Access Token field in Privy.
