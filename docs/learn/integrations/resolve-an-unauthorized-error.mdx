An 'Unauthorized' error indicates that Privy cannot connect to a linked account with the provided credentials. Any of the following scenarios can trigger this error:

* Updating the password or email address used to access the linked account.

* Deleting or editing an API key in the linked account.

* Revoking the permissions granted to Privy by the linked account.

* Uninstalling Privy from the linked account.

* The end of a trial period.

If any of these situations have occurred, displays that were previously synced to the linked account via the display's *Follow-Up* settings will fail until the issue is resolved. Additionally, if the error is tied to your e-commerce platform, displays will likely no longer be visible on your site. This is because store apps (e.g., Shopify) are typically responsible for incorporating the Privy code into your site content. If the code was installed manually, displays would continue to appear. 

## Check your connection

If one of your linked accounts is experiencing an 'Unauthorized" error, you will likely:

1. receive an automated email notification

2. see a prompt on your dashboard, in the *Settings* step of the display builder, or when creating a coupon.&#x20;

That said, if you suspect an issue and haven't seen an error message, you can manually test an account's connection. To test a linked account's connection to Privy: 

* Click on your Business Name in the upper right corner of your dashboard, then select the **Integrations** option from the dropdown menu. 

* In the *Authorized Accounts* section, select the **Test Account** button. 

If the connection is valid, a Connection Successful message will appear. If the connection is broken, then a Connection Failed message will appear. To restore a failed connection, follow the steps below:

## Identify the cause

Identify the most likely issue by reviewing the wording of any provided error messages and/or the list of likely scenarios listed in this guide's introduction. If none of these seem to fit your situation, check out [Privy's Status Page](https://status.privy.com/) and the affected linked account's status page to ensure there aren't broader platform issues on either side. 

## Restore the connection

To resolve an 'Unauthorized' error and restore the connection between Privy and the linked account:

* Navigate to the [Authorized Accounts](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts) section of your Privy settings. 

* Select the **Delete** icon next to the affected account and refresh the page. 

* After a page refresh, locate the desired provider, select it, and provide updated credentials. 

The selected provider should now appear as a linked account in the *Authorized Accounts* section. With a new connection established, please make sure to review the displays that previously synced to this account and ensure the **Sync Integrations** settings are properly configured.
