  This integration is no longer supported.

To sync contacts captured by your Privy displays to your Adroll account, you must connect the two accounts and add sync rules to your displays.

## Setting up the integration

The Adroll integration is unfortunately no longer supported at Privy, so accounts no longer have the option to connect their Privy account to Adroll moving forward. However, if you had an existing Adroll integration installed prior to December 2022, here's how to find it and test its connection:

1. Click on your business name in the upper right corner of your dashboard. Select **Integrations** from the dropdown menu.

2. View all existing integrations under the *Linked Accounts* section.

## Add a sync rule to your display

<Warning>
  These rules must be set for each display individually.
</Warning>

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to Adroll:

1. Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**. 

2. Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder.

3. Click to **Show Advanced Settings** in the lower left. Select the **Sync Integrations** card and click to Add a new integration.

4. Select **Adroll** from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**.
