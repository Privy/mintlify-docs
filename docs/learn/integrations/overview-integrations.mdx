## View and Manage Integrations

To set up a new integration, as well as view existing integrations and test their connections, click on your Business Name in the upper right corner of your dashboard and select **Integrations**.

## Remove Integrations

<Warning>
  **Note:** If you manually installed Privy on your site, such as those managed via WordPress.org or Squarespace, to use Privy displays (e.g., popups and banners), you must remove the Privy code from your website's HTML. This is not considered an integration. 
</Warning>

To remove an integration with an Email or SMS Service Provider, Smile.io, or Google Analytics, head to your Integrations page and select the **Delete** icon.



To remove an integration with an e-commerce provider:

1. Login to the e-commerce platform. 

2. Navigate to the platform's app settings, directory, or marketplace. Each provider's process is documented in their help center - [BigCommerce](https://support.bigcommerce.com/), [Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/app/help), and [Wix](https://support.wix.com/). 

3. Select the delete, remove, or uninstall option.

If another service is providing or promoting a Privy integration, please ensure it is also listed here in the Knowledge Base or on the [Privy website](https://www.privy.com/integrations). If it isn't, the integration does not fall within the scope of Privy's support team and may break or cause disruptions at any time.
