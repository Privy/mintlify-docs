title: "Sync Contacts to Shopify"
---

Privy automatically syncs all display signups to Shopify as mailable contacts after Privy is installed in your Shopify store. Each contact is added to your Shopify account's "Customers" list.  

## What information is included?

By default, the contact's email address, as well as their first and last name (if included in the sign up form), will be synced from your Privy display to your "Customers" list in Shopify. All of the synced contacts will be marked as `customer accepts email marketing` unless:

* **The display includes an Opt-In field**. An Opt-In field requires the contact to click an opt-in checkbox to signify that they want to receive your marketing emails. If the contact submits the display with the Opt-in option unchecked, they will be synced to your Shopify list with the `customer does not accept email marketing` status instead. 

* **The contact unsubscribes**. If a contact unsubscribes after the initial signup through a Privy display or email, their contact information in Shopify will automatically update to reflect a `customer does not accept email marketing` preference.

## Is more information available?

Yes. To include additional information in your sync, such as [Shopify tags](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/productivity-tools/using-tags): 

1. Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**. 

2. Select the desired display and navigate to your **Settings**. 

3. Click the **Sync Integrations** button, select **Shopify** from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**. 

<Warning>
  These settings must be set for each individual display.
</Warning>





Submissions to this display will now include this information when syncing. Navigate to the "Customers" dashboard in your Shopify account to filter by the tag via the "Customer Tags" option.



The information is also displayed in the "Tags" card when viewing a customer record in Shopify.
