An order summary is a personalized piece of content that you can leverage in your Purchase Follow-Up emails; it includes the items, quantities, prices, and total from your customer's order. It's a convenient way for a customer to confirm which items were included in their order.

<Warning>
  **Note:** This functionality is only available for accounts integrated with **Shopify** at this time.

## Add an order summary

Since an order summary is tied exclusively to a customer's order, it can only be included in a Purchase Follow-Up automation. To add an order summary to your content:

* Navigate to your [Automations](https://dashboard.privy.com/automations).

* Select an existing Purchase Follow-Up that you'd like to edit, or create a new one.

* Select the 'Edit' icon under the email that you'd like to add your order summary to.

* Drag and drop the **Order** block from the *Content* menu on the left side.
