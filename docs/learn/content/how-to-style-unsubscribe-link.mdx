By default, all Privy emails include an unsubscribe link in the email footer for contacts to opt out of your email communications in one click. This unsubscribe link can also be placed directly in the body of your email with a merge tag. Incorporating the link directly into the body content is particularly useful if you'd like to call more attention to the option as it can be customized while the default footer link cannot.&#x20;

Some situations in which you might want to call more attention to the unsubscribe link include: 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Audience Management" defaultOpen={false}>
    Unengaged subscribers are a major concern for proper list management as they can hurt your sending reputation over time. The longer they remain unengaged, the greater the likelihood that future emails will end up in the junk folder or spam filter. 

    To avoid this situation, a routine re-engagement campaign is recommended. Send your unengaged subscribers a targeted email acknowledging that they haven’t opened or clicked any messages in a while, and simply ask if they want to continue to receive your emails.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Facilitate Opt-out Requests" defaultOpen={false}>
    It’s crucial that you make unsubscribing to your emails as easy for your contacts as subscribing was in the first place. Never attempt to hide the unsubscribe link from a subscriber and if they'd like to unsubscribe themselves instead of having you facilitate it on their behalf, make the option obvious.

## Styling an unsubscribe link

To style the unsubscribe link in your email: 

* Locate and select the desired email to access its details.

* Select the **Edit design** to access the email editor.

* Drag a **Button** element from the *Content* menu on the left side. Click on the button to edit its settings and text.

* Copy and paste the following variable into the button's URL on the left side: **`{{ business.unsubscribe_link }}`**

* Once the merge tag is added, style the unsubscribe button as you normally would with any other button, and then **Save** your changes.



A custom unsubscribe link is now included in the body of your email. If a recipient clicks the link, they will be opted out and will not receive future emails sent from your Privy account. This action will not unsubscribe the contact from any other email service providers that you may also be using. 

<Warning>
  **Note:** When the email is sent, Privy will detect the custom unsubscribe variable and will remove the default unsubscribe link from the footer. Marketing emails must include an unsubscribe option to comply with various compliance frameworks, including [CAN-SPAM](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/can-spam-rule).
