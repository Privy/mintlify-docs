Personalization allows you to connect with your audience on an individual level, which can make all the difference when someone is quickly deciding between dismissing or engaging with your content. Adding personalization to subject lines, body content, and even call-to-actions can make a huge difference in connecting with your subscribers.

## How does personalization work?

Information collected about an individual is stored in fields on their contact profile (e.g., First Name). This information then becomes available for exhibition in your emails via **Merge Tags**. When viewed by a contact in an email, these tags automatically reference and show the information associated with the recipients' contact profile.

### Default or Fallback Values

For any merge tag, you can add a default value to provide a placeholder if there is no information available to pull in from the recipient's contact profile. If a default value isn't provided and there's no value on the contact profile, a blank space will appear instead. To include a default, manually type your merge tag into your content and use this format: 

`{{ contact.first_name|default:'there' }}`

| Example Merge Tag                                | Example Output                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Hi \{\{ contact.first\_name\|default:'there' }}, | "Hi John," **OR** "Hi there," |
