Coupon codes are great for rewarding loyal customers or encouraging visitors to take a specific action, such as signing up for your email list or completing a purchase. Follow the instructions below to learn how you can:

2. <a href="#edit-or-delete-a-coupon">Manage coupons</a>

3. <a href="#insert-a-coupon-into-your-content">Insert your coupons into displays, emails, and texts</a>

## Create a coupon

To create a new coupon code:

* Navigate to [Coupons](https://dashboard.privy.com/coupons) from the main navigation in your Privy dashboard.

* Select **New Coupon**.

* Give your new coupon a title, such as "Welcome Discount" — customers will not see this title.

* Select the source of your coupon. You will be able to select from three different locations:

  * **Shopify** or **BigCommerce**. These options allow you to push discounts to Shopify or BigCommerce without leaving your Privy account. If you are integrated with one of these providers, this option should be your go-to. 

  * **Manual**. Suppose you're not a Shopify or BigCommerce customer. In that case, you can manually create coupons in Privy individually or in bulk by uploading a file of codes to be distributed one at a time.

<Warning>
  If you are using a Manual coupon code, you must also create the coupon code(s) in your store in order for them to be valid at checkout.
</Warning>

* Select the type of coupon you'd like to use:

  * **Master Coupon:** Deliver one single code given to all sign ups or email/text recipients (i.e., "HELLO10")

  * **Unique Coupon:** Deliver codes that are uniquely generated for each individual sign up or email/text recipients. These appear as a random string of numbers and letters, and you have the option to add a prefix. (i.e., "HELLO-5HB28Z4")

* Configure your discount rules:

  * Create your code (or your option Code Prefix, if using a Unique Coupon).

  * Select your discount type (fixed amount, percentage, free shipping)

  * Add any additional rules, such as minimum purchase amount.

* Set a schedule if your coupon needs specific start and end dates (this setting is optional). **Save.**

* Navigate to [Coupons](https://dashboard.privy.com/coupons) from the main navigation in your Privy dashboard.
