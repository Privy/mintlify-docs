### Customize the product block

The Product block auto-populates with the selected product's title and primary image by default. The entire image and title area will direct the recipient to the associated product page in a new tab when clicked. To update or override these default settings:

* Click on the **Product** that you placed in your newsletter. 

* Customize the block's options, including the selected product, the image, the title/description, the on-click behavior, and other design elements in the left sidebar.
