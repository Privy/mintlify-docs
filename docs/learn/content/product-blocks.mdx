## Add the product block

* Navigate to your Campaigns or Automations to either select an existing email you'd like to edit, or create a new email.

* Select **Edit design** to access the email editor.

* Once you're in the email editor, drag and drop the **Product** block from your *Content* menu on the left.

* Search for the product you'd like to feature in the following prompt's dropdown menu. Once you find the desired product, click **Save.**



## Customize the product block

The Product block auto-populates with the selected product's title and primary image by default. The entire image and title area will direct the recipient to the associated product page in a new tab when clicked. To update or override these default settings:

* Click on the **Product** that you placed in your newsletter. 

* Customize the block's options, including the selected product, the image, the title/description, the on-click behavior, and other design elements in the left sidebar.
