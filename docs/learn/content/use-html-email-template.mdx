While the drag-and-drop email editor is recommended for most users due to its ease of use, you have the option to work with custom HTML if you already have a template or if you prefer to work directly with your code. 

There are two ways to use an HTML email template with Privy emails, and the approach differs slightly depending on the email type. Please review the available options below. 

<Warning>
  **Note:** While the Privy product supports custom HTML, the Privy support team cannot help you build out or troubleshoot your custom templates beyond the general guidance covered in this documentation. Please only import custom templates if you prefer working directly with source code and have the technical skills or resources to troubleshoot and resolve any issues.

## After Signup Emails

To use a custom HTML template in an after signup email: 

* Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays** via the main navigation. 

* Select the display in need of an after-signup email. 

* Select the **Follow-up** step in the display builder. 

* Click on the email card in the *After Signup Emails* section to open the email builder.

* Once in the editor, click the **Templates** button and select the **Switch editor** option from the dropdown menu. 

* Select the HTML editor option from the prompt and then confirm your choice by clicking the **Switch editor** button. 

* Replace the code of the default HTML email with your own and then select **Save**. 

<Warning>
  **Note:** The default Privy footer is still included when sending emails using a custom HTML template. Its inclusion ensures your emails meet the required compliance guidelines. That said, its inclusion may change how you decide to design your footer, so testing is recommended. 
</Warning>

If you choose to add additional emails and create a series, the editor options will present themselves automatically. 

## Campaigns and Automations

To use a custom HTML template for a Campaign, Abandoned Cart, Customer Winback, or Purchase Follow-up email: 

* Locate an existing email draft you'd like to edit, or create a new one. 

* Click to **Edit design** to open the drag-and-drop editor. 

* Remove all of the content from the existing template, leaving a single empty content block. 

* Add an **HTML** element to the empty content block, and then paste your HTML email template into the block via the sidebar.
