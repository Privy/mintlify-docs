Images are crucial for making messages easy to understand. Because the human brain processes images better than written language, photos and other visual designs convey information faster than text, reducing the reader’s response time to the message. [Studies show](https://medium.com/@iDashboards_UK/on-average-people-remember-only-20-of-what-they-read-but-80-of-what-they-see-8411224769e2) that people only remember 10% of what they hear and 20% of what they read, but 80% of what they see.

## Add an image

* Head to either [Campaigns](https://dashboard.privy.com/message-campaigns) or [Automations](https://dashboard.privy.com/automations) to locate and select the email that you'd like to edit.

* Once you're in the email editor, you can drag in a new image element from the left side.

* Click on the image element and select **Upload photo** on the left side.

* Select an existing photo from your *Photo Manager*, or:

  * **+ Upload New Photo:** Upload an image from your device.

  * **Select Shopify Product:** Pull an image from your Shopify products.

* Once your image is selected, click **Use This Photo** to add the image to your email.

Most people prefer to edit their images outside of Privy. However, if you find yourself wanting to crop your photo or make any other adjustments, follow these steps:

* Click on the photo in your email that you'd like to edit.

* On the left side, select **Edit photo**.

* Make any adjustments you'd like and click <Icon icon="check" /> **Apply** to apply your edits. **Save.**

## Alternate Text

Complying with [ADA guidelines](https://www.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/) for Web Accessibility requires including alt text in your images. To add alt text to your images:

* Click on the photo in your email that you'd like to add alt text to.

* On the left side, scroll to find your **Alternate Text** field and type in your alt text. **Save.**

## Linking your image

Adding links to your images is crucial to ensuring that your email content is interactive and actionable. You want to ensure that all images in your email content are linked so that customers can click on anything that interests them and they're brought exactly where they need to go.

To add links to images in your email:

* Click on the photo in your email that you'd like to link.

* On the left side, scroll down to the **Image Link** field under the *Action* settings of your image. Paste the URL that you want the image to be linked to. **Save.**
