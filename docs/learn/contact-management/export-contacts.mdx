Contact exports contain personally identifiable information (e.g., Email and Name), basic analytics (e.g., Sessions and Pageviews), Privy Tags, and custom properties with names under 64 characters. All of this information is clearly labeled in the export's header row. 

## Export Contacts to CSV

To export contacts in your account to a CSV: 

* Navigate to **Contacts > All Contacts** via the main navigation. 

* If you want to export a specific segment of customers, select the desired filters from the left sidebar and click the **Filter** button. If none are selected, the export contains all contacts. 

* Select the **"with contacts"** dropdown menu.

* Select **Download CSV** from the dropdown menu's options. 

* Confirm your decision by selecting the **Email CSV** button in the prompt.

When the export is ready, an email containing a download link will be sent to the email address associated with the Privy account which you are currently logged in. To review which email address you are logged in with, click on your Business Name in the upper right corner of your dashboard and select **My Information** from the dropdown menu.

* Click the **Download File** button in the email.

## Troubleshooting

<Icon icon="circle-question" /> **I didn't receive my export email!**

File preparation can take multiple minutes, especially if your export contains many contacts. That said, if you are still encountering issues receiving or accessing your exported CSVs via email, navigate to the [Exports](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/exports) section of your account's *Business Settings* and initiate the download from there.
