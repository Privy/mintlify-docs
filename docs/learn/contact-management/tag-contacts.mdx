## What is a Privy Tag?

Privy Tags are labels that you create to organize your contacts. Privy Tags are highly customizable and can be applied during an import or via a contact's profile. Privy Tags can be used in a variety of ways to identify customers, such as wholesale clients, local customers, VIP customers, and more. Once a tag is applied, it becomes available for contact filtering and audience segmentation. 

## Add Tags during a Contact Import

When you [import a spreadsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/privy.com/support/example_privy_import.csv) (CSV) of contacts, you will reach a **Tags** step. This step in the import process allows you to apply new or existing tags to all of the contacts included in the import file.
