Unsubscribing is removing an email address from a mailing list so that it does not receive any further messages from your business.&#x20;

Every email you send from Privy includes an unsubscribe link, allowing subscribers to opt-out with one click at any time. These links are critical for your marketing strategy because they prevent you from sending emails to individuals who no longer wish to receive them. Having a list with a genuinely interested audience along with good[ list hygiene](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/13-list-hygiene-clean-your-email-list) enhances deliverability and boosts your[ email performance](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/120-understand-email-engagement).&#x20;

Unsubscribes can also be done by you, following the steps below.

## Individual unsubscribe

To individually unsubscribe a contact:

* Head to **Contacts > All Contacts**.

* Search for the contact's email address that you'd like to unsubscribe. Once you find the correct contact, click to open their contact profile.

* Next, select **Unsubscribe** in the upper right corner and confirm your decision in the following prompt.



## Bulk unsubscribe

Bulk unsubscribing contacts in Privy must be made via a CSV file containing the contact's information. To correctly import these files, you must have your data formatted properly. A sample file is available for download [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/privy.com/support/example_privy_import.csv). Please make sure your import meets the following criteria:

* The file must use the CSV format. 

* The file must include an email address column.

* The first row of the file must contain column headers. These headers are not case-sensitive and are used to match the imported values with customer attributes (fields) in Privy. 

* Your file should contain exclusively Non-mailable (unsubscribed) contacts. 

Once you're ready to go:

* Head to **Contacts > All Contacts.**

* Select the **Add Contacts** option.

* Choose the **CSV Upload** option from the dropdown menu.

* Click **Choose File** to locate the CSV file on your computer. Once you have selected the file, click **Next** in the lower right corner.



* On the *Match your columns* page, you will match the file's column headers with customer attributes (fields) in Privy. Use the dropdown menus to select an existing attribute or click **Create New Field** to create a new custom field to store the information. After matching all of the fields and identifying one of them as the required email field, click **Next**.  

<Tip>
  When importing contacts as unsubscribed, 'email' is the only column you need to import.
