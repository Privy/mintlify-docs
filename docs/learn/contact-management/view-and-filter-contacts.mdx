The information collected about your contacts is stored in their contact profiles. These profiles are viewable and filterable based on various contact attributes, detected attributes, and tags. These filters allow you to quickly identify segments of your audience for additional review or export. 

## Filtering your Contacts

To filter the contact profiles in your account:

* Navigate to **Contacts** via the main navigation. 

* Apply the desired filter(s) via the sidebar menu and then select the **Filter** button. Any contacts that meet the specified criteria will appear on the dashboard. The number of contacts that meet the criteria will appear at the top of the table and in the *With X contacts* dropdown menu.
