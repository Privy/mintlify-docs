## What is a segment?

***

A segment is a group of contacts defined by a set of conditions. Unlike a static subscriber list, segments are dynamic, meaning they grow as contacts meet the segment's conditions and shrink as contacts no longer meet them. Segmented email sends often return more revenue per recipient than unsegmented sends since they can be tailored to a particular situation, and thus are more relevant to the recipients.

Privy offers two kinds of segments:

1. <a href="#custom-segments">Custom Segments</a>

2. <a href="#smart-segments">Smart Segments</a>

Check out the following guide on how to build, manage, and use your segments in Privy.

## Custom Segments

Custom Segments are built from scratch by you! You can customize a group of your subscribers by combining a number of filters and criteria such as Shopping Activity, Email Engagement, Website Activity, and Customer Attributes.

### Create a new segment

There are a couple ways to access the Custom Segment builder:

<Icon icon="circle-1" /> **From the Segments Page:** head to [Contacts > Segments](https://dashboard.privy.com/segments) and click **Create Segment.**

<Icon icon="circle-2" /> **From your Campaign:** when creating a Campaign, click to edit who you're sending to. Click **+ Create Segment** under the "Send To" section.

Now you're ready to build your segment:

* Name your segment. This is internal only — your contacts will not see this name.

* Select whether you want your contacts to **Match all** criteria or **Match any** criteria. For stricter segmentation, you'll want to select Match all.

* Click the **Choose Category** menu to start selecting your conditions for your segment.&#x20;

* To add more conditions, select the **+ And** or the **+ Or** buttons to start selecting the next condition.

* The contact count will adjust as you add filter(s). Once you're happy with your segment, click **Create.**
