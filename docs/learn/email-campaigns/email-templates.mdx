Our drag-and-drop email editor allows you to quickly and easily create email templates for both campaigns and automations. Each email created with the editor will render a clean and responsive design on almost any email client and device type. 

<Note>
  While the drag-and-drop email editor is recommended for most users due to its ease of use, you can work with custom HTML if you already have a template or if you prefer to work directly with your code. If you'd like to build your email templates with HTML, [check out this guide](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/content/use-html-email-template).
</Note>

## Create a new email

To access the drag-and-drop email editor, you first need to create a new email draft:

1. If you plan on building a new automated email, head to [Automations](https://dashboard.privy.com/automations) and click **New Automation**. Select which Automation you want to create. Once you're in the series builder, select the 'edit' icon below the email you want to edit. This will open the email editor.

2. If you plan on building a new campaign, head to [Campaigns](https://dashboard.privy.com/message-campaigns) and click **New email**. Click **Choose Template** to select a template and access the email editor.

For an existing Campaign draft, you can select **Edit design** from the Campaign's details page:



## Choose a template

Privy offers a number of basic and stylized email templates that you can start with. To select a template, click **Templates** at the top of your editor and select **Choose a template** from the dropdown menu.

Browse and preview your templates. Once you find the template you want to start with, choose **Select.**



## Edit the email's styles

To change the default styles of your email, select the **Body** tab from the sidebar. This page allows you to change the width and alignment of the email's content. Additionally, it allows you to update the default background color, font, and link styling options for content added to the template. *Content already included or added to the template will not change.* 



<Warning>
  **Note:** A content width larger than 600px is not recommended. 
</Warning>

## Edit the email's layout

### Add new blocks

To add a new section to your email, drag and drop the **Columns** block from the *Content* menu on the left.

### Edit existing blocks

To edit existing blocks, hover over your email content. Click on the background just outside of your email content to highlight the entire block of content.

<Icon icon="circle-plus" /> **Add columns:** On the left, you can edit the layout by adding or removing columns to your content.

<Icon icon="circle-minus" /> **Removing blocks:** If you want to remove the entire block of columns, select the 'delete' icon on the right side of the block.

<Icon icon="copy" /> **Duplicate blocks:** If you want to duplicate an entire section in your email, select the 'duplicate' icon on the right side of the block.

<Icon icon="arrows-up-down-left-right" /> **Move blocks:** To move sections of your email, click and drag the blue 'move' icon to the right side of the block. You can snap the block to sit in a different location in your email's body.

<Icon icon="fill-drip" /> **Change color and padding:** When a block is selected, you can edit its settings (such as it's background color and padding) on the left side.
