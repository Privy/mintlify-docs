Once you start sending email campaigns in Privy, you're going to want to check in on their performance to track their engagement metrics, revenue, and delivery. Below is a guide on how to find your Campaigns' reporting, and how to interpret it.

Campaigns Table

To get an overview of your Campaigns' performance:

* Head to your [Campaigns](https://dashboard.privy.com/message-campaigns) page.

* Feel free to utilize the search, sort, and filter options at the top of your table. *For example, if you want to only view your most recent Sent emails, Filter by Status: Sent and click the 'Send Date' column to sort by your emails' send date.*

In the top right, you’ll find the total **Revenue Generated** for the Campaigns you’re viewing in the table below. If you click the arrow next to your Revenue Generated, you’ll see a dropdown with an aggregate view of the number of messages delivered, opened, and clicked + orders attributed since account creation.



If you take a look at the table, you’ll get a line-by-line view of each Campaign, their Title, Subject Line, Status, and the following metrics:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Delivered" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total number of contacts whose email server sent Privy a response stating that the email was delivered.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Opened" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total number of contacts who had an email delivered and opened the email. Privy embeds an invisible image into the email message once it is sent when you send an email. When your recipient views the email and the images load, Privy knows that the email was opened.  If the recipient's email client doesn't allow the image to load, Privy will not track the email open.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clicked" defaultOpen={false}>
    The percentage of contacts who had an email delivered and clicked on any link in the email.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unsubscribed" defaultOpen={false}>
    The percentage of contacts who had an email delivered and unsubscribed from further messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revenue" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total revenue collected from all messages in this series. *Privy uses a last-touch model with a 7-day attribution window. If a customer has opened/clicked multiple emails within the seven days proceeding a purchase, the revenue will only count toward the most recent email.* 
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Individual Campaign Reporting

To drill down into an individual campaign's metrics:

* Head to your [Campaigns](https://dashboard.privy.com/message-campaigns) page.

* Locate the desired email campaign and click on its Title or Subject Line to access its own reporting page.

On this page, you'll find a preview of your sent message, Delivery & Engagement Reports, click tracking, and an Activity table for your recipients.

### Overview

At the top of your campaign's reporting page, you'll find:

1. The ability to view and/or update your campaign's Title&#x20;

2. The total amount of Revenue Generated by this campaign

3. An overview of the recipients, send date, and sender information

4. A preview of your Subject Line and content



### Delivery Report

Below your overall performance metrics, your Delivery Report shows how many emails were sent, delivered, bounced, and rejected. To reveal the exact number that the percentages represent, hover over the bars in the chart. 



### Engagement Report

Your Engagement Report shows how recipients interacted with your email once they received it. This report has five metrics that can help you gauge the success of your email. To reveal the exact number that the percentages represent, hover over the bars in the chart. 



### Interactions

Below your Delivery & Engagement Reports, you'll find an Interactions table which tracks the number of times each link was clicked in your email:



### Activity

Below your Interactions table, you'll find an Activity table which shows all the recipients of your campaign. With the Activity table, you can:

1. Filter by activity (delivered, opened, clicked, ordered, unopened, bounced, unsubscribed, rejected, reported as spam).

2. Export as CSV. *By clicking this, you will be emailed a link to download your file.*



To view more detailed information on a contact's activities, you can click on a recipient's email address directly in the table; this will open their contact profile in a separate tab.

<Warning>
  When exporting a CSV, the file will include all delivery and engagement activity from all recipients.&#x20;
