Newsletters are a powerful tool for any e-commerce business. The messages sent through this channel can communicate important information, establish your brand's reputation, strengthen your relationship with customers, and help move recipients through your sales funnel.

With campaigns you can:

1. <a href="#customize-your-template" >Customize email templates with our drag-and-drop editor.</a>

2. <a href="#edit-your-campaign's-details" >Send one-time emails to all of your contacts, or a segment of your audience.</a>

3. <a href="#send-or-schedule-your-campaign" >Select the specific date and time you want your message to send.</a>

## Create a new campaign

* Navigate to [Campaigns](https://dashboard.privy.com/message-campaigns).

* Click **New email** in the upper right.

## Customize your template

* To start designing your template, click **Choose a template**.

* You'll be able to browse our Basic Templates, Privy Templates, Seasonal Templates, or your own Saved Templates folder. Choose which template you want to start with and click **Select.**

* Once you select your template, you can use our drag and drop editor to customize the design.

* After you're finished designing your email, make sure you click **Save** to save all changes, and click **Next** to edit your campaign's settings.

## Edit your campaign's details

The final step before sending or scheduling your campaign is to edit your campaign's details, including your email's name, recipients, sender details, subject line and preview text, and coupon. After you make changes to these details, make sure you **Save** your work.

### Email Name

This is internal only. Your customers will not see this name, it is for you to keep organized. This name is also important because it will appear in your reporting and your email segmentation.

### Recipients

Under the **"To"** section, click the 'edit' icon to select which contacts you'd like to send your campaign to.&#x20;

You can send to All Contacts, or you can select a [Custom or Smart Segment](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/email-campaigns/segmentation) to target your email to a specific group of your list. You also have the option to exclude a segment from receiving your email under **"Don't send to"**.

Click **Done** to save your changes.

### Sender Details

Under the **"From"** section, click the 'edit' icon to edit or confirm your sender details, including your sending domain and your reply-to address. Click **Done** to save your changes.

<Note>
  **Note:** To update the default From Name and Address used for your emails, navigate to the *Sender Options* section of your [account settings](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/email). Additionally, consider [updating your sending domain](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/deliverability/use-a-custom-sending-domain) so you can use custom addresses associated with your domain and improve your deliverability. 
</Note>

### Subject Line and Preview Text

Under the **"Subject"** section, click the 'edit' icon to edit your Subject Line and Preview Text. It's important to use unique, eye-catching Subject Lines for each of your emails. Your Preview Text is the text that follows immediately after your Subject Line in most email programs. Click **Done** to save your changes.

### Coupon

If you're using a Coupon merge tag in your Campaign, make sure that you attach your coupon code here. Click the 'edit' icon, select the desired coupon from the dropdown menu, and click **Done** to save your changes.

## Preview and test your campaign

Whether you're on your Campaign's details page or in the email editor, you can **Preview** your email on desktop and mobile, or **Send a test email** by selecting these options at the top of the page.

  **Note:** When sending a test email, you can choose up to 5 Privy users. To manage your account's users, follow this guide.
