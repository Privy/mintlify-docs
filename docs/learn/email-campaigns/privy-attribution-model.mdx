## What is Attribution?

In marketing, attribution refers to identifying and assigning credit to the various touchpoints a customer interacts with before making a purchase. It can help you understand which marketing efforts are driving conversions and generating revenue.

## How does Attribution work with Email + Text?

Privy attributes an order if a contact engages (opens or clicks) with a marketing message and completes the order within 7 days. There are a few more points to keep in mind:

* **Last Touch Attribution:** Orders are attributed to the last message a contact engaged with. For example, if a subscriber opens a Campaign email and later opens an Abandoned Cart Automation email before purchasing, the order is attributed to the Abandoned Cart Automation.

* **Multi-Channel Attribution:** Privy evaluates each channel's attribution window separately when using multiple message channels (SMS or email). This determines if either channel should receive revenue attribution at the time of purchase.

* **Conversion Window:** The conversion window for both email and SMS is 7 days, starting from the moment of engagement.

* **Contact-based Attribution:** Privy uses a contact’s email address and phone number to attribute an order back to a contact. 

## How does Attribution work for Displays?

An order is counted when someone signs up for your Privy display and then completes a purchase through your store using the same email address or phone number at any point in the future. Privy counts an order regardless of whether or not the customer used a discount code. This attribution model helps merchants understand which displays ultimately lead to orders. 

## FAQs

Here are some answers to common questions we hear when it comes to attribution:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does attribution work for Automation series that have multiple emails?" defaultOpen={false} icon="circle-question">
    Similar to Campaigns, our Automations use a last-touch interaction model, so the order will only be attributed to the email that the customer *most recently* engaged with prior to placing the order.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Attribution Work Differently Between Emails and SMS?" defaultOpen={false} icon="circle-question">
    Yes, attribution works differently between emails and SMS due to the nature of these channels:

    * **Emails:** Attribution in emails is based on opens and/or clicks. This tracking is accomplished through hidden, embedded tracking links and pixels automatically included in each email.

    * **SMS:** SMS attribution uses link tracking, as SMS messages do not support tracking pixels. When a recipient clicks on a link in an SMS, their activity is tracked and attributed accordingly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize the attribution model?" defaultOpen={false} icon="circle-question">
    It is not possible to change the attribution model. Privy adheres to industry-standard attribution windows and methodologies.

## Matching Privy Attribution to other platforms

Attributed revenue and orders in Privy might not match other reports due to differences in attribution models. For example:

* **Different Attribution Windows:** Other platforms may use different time frames for attribution.

* **Touch-based vs. Click-based Attribution:** Some tools or e-commerce platforms may use narrower attribution models, such as only providing attribution credit to the last click. 

* **Multi-Touch vs. Last-Touch Attribution:** Some systems credit the last touchpoint, while others may distribute credit across multiple touchpoints.

* **Data Processing Delays:** Timing differences in data updates and synchronization can cause discrepancies.

Attributed revenue in Privy should be considered a proxy or indicator of the effectiveness of your email and SMS marketing efforts. While our attribution model aims to provide a clear picture of which marketing activities are driving conversions, it is not the complete source of truth. For a comprehensive understanding of your marketing performance, it's important to consider attributed revenue alongside other metrics and data sources.
