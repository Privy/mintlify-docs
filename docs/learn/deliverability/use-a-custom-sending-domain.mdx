The default address used to send emails from your account is a shared Privy address. However, to [improve your email deliverability](https://www.privy.com/blog/how-to-improve-email-deliverability) and build trust with your email recipients, this address should be updated to reflect your specific domain and brand.&#x20;

If you see your domain host below, please click to follow their platform-specific instructions instead:

​Please ensure that you meet the following requirements before proceeding: 

* You must own a domain name - addresses from free providers like Gmail or Yahoo won't work.

* You must have the ability to update the DNS records of your domain.

* You must be hosting a website at the root of the domain. 

**Note:** The approach to updating DNS records varies from one provider to another. If you encounter issues locating these settings, please contact the provider directly.

## Add the domain

To add a new sending domain:

* Click on your Business Name in the upper right corner of your Privy dashboard. Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu.

* In the sidebar, select **Sending Domain** under the *Email Settings* section. 

* Click the **+ Add Sending Domain** button in the upper right. 

* In the prompt, enter your domain name (e.g., example.com) and click the **Save** button. The provided domain must be a root domain, not a subdomain (e.g., mail.example.com).

## Update your DNS Information

After completing the previous steps, DNS records are generated for your domain. The records are automatically presented to you after saving the domain for the first time. However, if you have navigated away from the page, you can easily access the records by returning to your [Sending Domain](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/sending-domains) settings, locating the domain, and clicking the **DNS Records** button.

Once you've accessed the records:

* Add each of them to your DNS provider. There is a mix of CNAME and TXT records.

* Once all of the records are added, return to the records in Privy and click the **Verify and Set Default** button next to the domain. This action will check if the DNS records were updated correctly and set the domain as the default for your emails going forward.

<Warning>
  **Note:** It can take up to 48 hours for the DNS records to propagate and properly verify.
</Warning>

## Update your default domain

After verifying your sending domain, you can update the default "from" address for emails sent from your account. If you don't update these settings, emails will be sent using "offers" as the username paired with your custom sending domain. To update this setting:

* Click on your Business Name in the upper right corner of your Privy dashboard. Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu.

* In the sidebar, select **Sender Options** under the *Email Settings* section.

* Input the desired address before the "@" symbol in the 
  *Default From Email* field. 

* Ensure the desired custom domain appears to the right of the "@" symbol.

* Click the **Save Changes** button to confirm your selections. 

Completion of this process will update all emails that you create moving forward. Check out this example from our Space Age Trading Cards friends, who combined "launches" with their custom sending domain to create their default From Email address.

To update this setting for emails set up before the change: 

* Go into the email editor and click on the **From** option under the *Sender Info* section.

* Enter the desired address information and select a verified domain from the dropdown menu.

* Click **Save**.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Records

Typically, we'd suggest that you copy and paste the host values provided in your account:

```
scph1218._domainkey
s1._domainkey
s2._domainkey
privy-sg
privy._verification
```

However, some providers will not verify when your brand and top-level domains are excluded from these host values. For example, if you enter privy-sg in the Host Name, the provider will throw an error because it expects privy-sg.yourdomain.com instead.

Add your domain information to each host value to troubleshoot this issue and input those values instead. After adding your domain to the records, they will look something like the following:

```
scph1218._domainkey.yourdomain.com
s1._domainkey.yourdomain.com
s2._domainkey.yourdomain.com
privy-sg.yourdomain.com
privy._verification.yourdomain.com
```

<Note>
  **Note:** It's okay if the TXT record for scphXXXX.\_domainkey is not verified. In some cases, your domain will use the hosting provider's DKIM instead.
</Note>

### Pending verification

In most cases, the records should be verified almost immediately when entered into the host correctly. However, some changes will require up to 48 hours to take effect. If your records have not been verified after 48 hours, please do the following:

* Review the "Why won't my DNS records verify?" guide.

* Attempt the verification process again.

* Contact your web host for assistance.

* Email our [DNS Support](mailto:domainservice@privy.com) for more help.
