Abandoned Cart Emails automatically follow up with contacts who leave items in their cart without completing their purchase. Almost 70% of carts get abandoned for one reason or another, so activating an Abandoned Cart email series is one of the most valuable tools for any e-commerce business! Our merchants typically recover between 10% and 20% of their abandoned carts.

Don't leave money on the table — read the below step-by-step instructions to get your Abandoned Cart Email series up and running.

<Note>
  To use our Abandoned Cart Emails, your account must be integrated with BigCommerce, Shopify, Shopify Plus, Weebly, or Wix.

## Edit your settings

When creating your Abandoned Cart Series, you have a number of trigger settings that you can configure: your time delay, a minimum/maximum order value, specific products/collections targeting, and your coupon.

To edit your settings, scroll to find your **Edit settings** button at the bottom of the left side bar.



### Time Delay

Configure your time delay to determine how long your first email triggers after the cart is abandoned, and how much of a delay there is between each subsequent email triggers. You can customize each email’s time delay by number of minutes, hours, or days.

### Minimum/Maximum Order Value

This setting is optional. It allows you to restrict this series from triggering unless the customers' cart meets a certain minimum or maximum subtotal in their cart. By default, this is set to a minimum of $1 with no order maximum, which means that carts with any and all value will receive this series once they are abandoned by an eligible contact.

### Products/Collections

This setting is optional. It allows you to restrict this series from triggering unless the customers' cart contains your selected products or collections. By default, this setting is disabled, which means that an abandoned cart will trigger this series regardless of which products are in the cart.

### Coupon

Attach a coupon code to your series. By default, none of the emails in the default series templates include a coupon code. However, if you want to attach a coupon code, you can [follow these instructions](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/content/coupon-codes#automations:~:text=To%20insert%20a%20coupon%20in%20your%20Automation%3A) to insert a code into your templates as you customize them!

<Warning>
  Only 1 coupon can be attached per email series.
</Warning>

## Customize your templates

By default, your templates will include a **Cart Summary**, which will reveal each product in your customer's cart, as well as Call-To-Actions leading directly to your customer's cart URL.

Click **Preview** to see a mobile and desktop preview of your content, or click **Send test email** to send a test email to yourself and/or other users on your Privy account.



Once you’ve made all your edits, click **Save**. Click **Back to series** to exit the editor and head back to your Welcome Series.

## Activate your series

<Warning>
