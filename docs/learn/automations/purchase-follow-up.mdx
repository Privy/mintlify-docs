The post-purchase period is a crucial point in your customer's journey, so a Purchase Follow-Up email is an essential tool for building brand loyalty, nurturing relationships, and creating repeat customers. Follow this step-by-step guide to get your Purchase Follow-Up emails up and running and delivering value to your customers.

<Note>
  To send Purchase Follow-Up Emails, you need to be integrated with BigCommerce, Shopify, Shopify Plus, or Wix so that your customers’ order activity is available to Privy. 
</Note>

## Create a new Purchase Follow-Up email

* Navigate to [**Automations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/automations) and click the **New Automation** button.

## Edit your settings

When creating your Purchase Follow-Up series, you have a number of settings that you can configure, including your time delay, customer action, order count, minimum/maximum order value, products/collections, and coupon.&#x20;

To edit your settings, click the **Edit settings** button on the left side bar.

### Time delay

Configure your time delay to determine how long your first email triggers since the customer's order was placed or delivered, and how much of a delay there is between each subsequent email triggers. You can customize each email’s time delay by number of minutes, hours, or days.

### Customer Action

Choose between **Placed an order** or **Received the order** (Shopify Only - A [default shipping carrier](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping/shipping-carriers) with tracking information is required).

### Order Count

Choose between **Any number of orders**, someone's **First order**, or **More than one order** (repeat customers).

### Minimum/Maximum Order Value

This setting is optional. It allows you to restrict this series from triggering unless the customers’ order meets a certain minimum or maximum subtotal in their cart. By default, these settings are disabled, which means that an order will trigger this series regardless of their value.

### Products/Collections

This setting is optional. It allows you to restrict this series from triggering unless the customers’ order contains your selected products or collections. By default, this setting is disabled, which means that an order will trigger this series regardless of which products are in the order.

### Coupon

Attach a coupon code to your series. By default, none of the emails in the default series templates include a coupon code. However, if you want to attach a coupon code, you can [follow these instructions](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/content/coupon-codes#automations:~:text=To%20insert%20a%20coupon%20in%20your%20Automation%3A) to insert a code into your templates as you customize them!

<Warning>
  Only 1 coupon can be attached per email series.
</Warning>

## Customize your templates

To edit the appearance of each of your emails, click the Edit icon to access the email editor:

Click **Templates** and select **Choose a Template** from the dropdown menu to start with one of Privy’s templates, or choose one of your own Saved Templates. If you need help using our drag and drop email editor, [check out this guide](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/email-campaigns/email-templates).

To edit the email’s Subject Line and Preview Text, click to edit the bar at the top of the email editor. Click done to close the bar after making your changes:

By default, the template will include an **Order Summary**, which will display each item, quantity, price, and total of your customer's order. This is an optional element.

Click **Preview** to see a mobile and desktop preview of your content, or click **Send test email** to send a test email to yourself and/or other users on your Privy account.

Once you’ve made all your edits, click **Save**. Click **Back to series** to exit the editor and head back to your Welcome Series.

## Activate your series

Once you’ve customized your templates and edited your settings, you’re ready to launch your Purchase Follow-Up Series! Click the **Activate** button in the upper right corner of your series.

<Warning>
  After your series is activated, you will not be able to add/remove emails from your series. To accomplish this, you will need to duplicate or start a new series.
</Warning>

Once your series is live, you can [review its performance](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/automations/automations-reporting) at any time.
