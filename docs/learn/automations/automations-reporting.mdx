Once your Automations are live, you're going to want to check in on their performance to track their engagement metrics, revenue, and delivery. Below is a guide on how to find your Automations' reporting and how to interpret it.

## Automations Table

To get an overview of your Automations' performance:

* Navigate to [Automations](https://dashboard.privy.com/automations).

* To narrow down your view of your Automations table, you can use the Search and Filter functions at the top of the table to narrow down by status, type, and channel. *For example, if you only want to view your active Automations, filter by Status: Active.*

In the top right, you'll find the total **Revenue Generated** for the Automations you're viewing in the table below. If you click the arrow next to your Revenue Generated, you'll see a dropdown with an aggregate view of the number of messages delivered, opened, and clicked since account creation.

If you take a look at the table, you'll get a line-by-line view of each Automation, their Title, Subject Line, Status, and the following metrics:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Delivered" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total number of contacts whose email server sent Privy a response stating that the email was delivered.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Opened" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total number of contacts who had an email delivered and opened the email. Privy embeds an invisible image into the email message once it is sent when you send an email. When your recipient views the email and the images load, Privy knows that the email was opened.  If the recipient's email client doesn't allow the image to load, Privy will not track the email open.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clicked" defaultOpen={false}>
    The percentage of contacts who had an email delivered and clicked on any link in the email.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unsubscribed" defaultOpen={false}>
    The percentage of contacts who had an email delivered and unsubscribed from further messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revenue" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total revenue collected from all messages in this series. *Privy uses a last-touch model with a 7-day attribution window. If a customer has opened/clicked multiple emails within the seven days proceeding a purchase, the revenue will only count toward the most recent email.* 
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

If your Automation is a series, you can view the above metrics for each individual message in the series by clicking the arrow to the left of the series on your table:

## Attribution Model

In marketing, attribution refers to identifying and assigning credit to the various touch points a customer interacts with before making a purchase. It can help you understand which marketing efforts are driving conversions and generating revenue.

Privy attributes an order if a contact engages (opens or clicks) with a marketing message and completes the order within 7 days.&#x20;

There are a few more points to keep in mind:

* **Last Touch Attribution:** Orders are attributed to the last message a contact engaged with. For example, if a subscriber opens a Campaign email and later opens an Abandoned Cart Automation email before purchasing, the order is attributed to the Abandoned Cart Automation.

* **Multi-Channel Attribution:** Privy evaluates each channel's attribution window separately when using multiple message channels (SMS or email). This determines if either channel should receive revenue attribution at the time of purchase.

* **Conversion Window:** The conversion window for both email and SMS is 7 days, starting from the moment of engagement.

* **Contact-based Attribution:** Privy uses a contact’s email address and phone number to attribute an order back to a contact.
