If you're using Privy Text, you can enable abandoned cart messages which send to textable contacts who visit your site, add an item to their cart, and then leave without completing the purchase. Sending these messages encourages your contacts to complete their purchase — it's one of the most impactful tools you can use to recover revenue for your business.

**Before you get started...**

Please review the following:

<Icon icon="check" /> You must be on our Growth Plan. You need to have an [approved toll-free number](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/compliance/toll-free-verification) and [textable contacts](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/compliance/understand-sms-consent).

<Icon icon="check" /> You must integrate with Shopify, Shopify Plus, BigCommerce, Weebly, or Wix.

<Icon icon="check" /> To ensure shoppers do not receive multiple messages, you should disable abandoned checkout or abandoned cart text messages from other SMS providers. 

## Create a new Abandoned Cart Text

To create a new Abandoned Cart text message:

* Navigate to [Automations](https://dashboard.privy.com/automations) and click the **New Automation** button.

* Select the **Abandoned Cart** **Text** option from the popup. This will open the text message editor.

* At the top of the screen, update the text's default title. This is internal only.

## Write your text message

Under **Text Message Content**, start to type out and write your message. A preview of your message will appear on the right side.

Be sure to personalize your message with a Coupon Code (if necessary) and a Cart URL so that your recipient can find their way to check out. Use the **Personalization tags** dropdown menu to insert these into your message!

## Edit your settings

Scroll to find, edit, and save your Trigger and Coupon settings:

### Minimum/Maximum Cart Value

This setting is optional. It allows you to restrict this text from triggering unless the customers’ cart meets a certain minimum or maximum subtotal in their cart. By default, this is set to a minimum cart value of $1 with no maximum cart value, which means that carts with any and all value will receive this message once they are abandoned by a textable contact.

### Products/Collections

This setting is optional. It allows you to restrict this text from triggering unless the customers’ cart contains your selected products or collections. By default, this setting is disabled, which means that an abandoned cart will trigger this message regardless of which products are in the cart.

### Time since last seen

Configure your time delay to determine how long you wait to trigger your text after the cart is abandoned by your textable contact.

### Coupon

If you are including a coupon code personalization tag in your text message, make sure that you attach the desired coupon in this section.

## Activate your text

Once your message is ready, select the **Activate** button at the top of the editor. Moving forward, the text will be sent to all eligible contacts who meet the criteria you set.



<Warning>
  Phone carrier policies mandate that only 1 Abandoned Cart Text can be sent per Cart Abandonment. We will not send any messages that do not follow this policy.
</Warning>

After you activate your Abandoned Cart Text, you can [review its performance](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/automations/automations-reporting) at any time.

## Deactivate your text

* Navigate to [Automations](https://dashboard.privy.com/automations).&#x20;

* Locate and select your Abandoned Cart Text.

* In the upper right, select the **Deactivate** button and confirm your decision.
