A Customer Winback email is an easy way to automate your retention strategy by automatically engaging with customers who haven't bought from you in a while. Repeat customers are 9x more likely to convert, spend 3x your average order value, and are 20% more profitable for your business, therefore reaching out to them is more than worth your while!

Follow this step-by-step guide to get your Customer Winback automation up and running.

<Note>
  To send Customer Winback Emails, you need to be integrated with BigCommerce, Shopify, Shopify Plus, or Wix so that your customers' order history is available to Privy. 
</Note>

## Create a new Customer Winback series

* Navigate to [**Automations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/automations) and click the **New Automation** button.

* Select the **Customer Winback** option. This action opens Privy’s series editor.



### Name your series

* At the top of your series editor, you’ll be able to edit and update the name of your series — this is internal only and for you to keep yourself organized.

### Add/Remove emails

* To add more emails to your series, click on any of the ‘plus’ signs between the emails.

* To remove an email from your series, click on the trash icon at the bottom of the email you’d like to delete.



<Info>
  The minimum amount of emails needed is 1. The maximum amount of emails allowed in a series is 10.

## Edit your settings

When creating your Customer Winback series, you have a couple of settings that you can configure: the time delay and your coupon. To edit your settings, click the **Edit settings** button on the left side bar.



### Time delay

Configure your time delay to determine how long your first email triggers after the customer's last order, and how much of a delay there is between each subsequent email triggers. You can customize each email’s time delay by number of minutes, hours, or days.

### Coupon

Attach a coupon to your series. [Follow these instructions](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/content/coupon-codes#automations:~:text=To%20insert%20a%20coupon%20in%20your%20Automation%3A) to insert a coupon code into your email content!

<Warning>
  Only 1 coupon can be attached per email series.
</Warning>

## Customize your templates

To edit the appearance of each of your emails, click the Edit icon to access the email editor:



Click **Templates** and select **Choose a Template** from the dropdown menu to start with one of Privy’s templates, or choose one of your own Saved Templates. If you need help using our drag and drop email editor, check out this guide.

To edit the email’s Subject Line and Preview Text, click to edit the bar at the top of the email editor. Click done to close the bar after making your changes:



Click **Preview** to see a mobile and desktop preview of your content, or click **Send test email** to send a test email to yourself and/or other users on your Privy account.

Once you’ve made all your edits, click **Save**. Click **Back to series** to exit the editor and head back to your Welcome Series.

## Activate your series

Once you’ve customized your templates and edited your settings, you’re ready to launch your Customer Winback Series! Click the **Activate** button in the upper right corner.

<Warning>
  After your series is activated, you will not be able to add/remove emails from your series. To accomplish this, you will need to duplicate or start a new series.
</Warning>

After you activate your series, you can [review its performance](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/automations/automations-reporting) at any time.
