A Welcome Series is a sequence of individual welcome emails that are sent to someone after they sign up on one of your Privy displays. This automation is an essential part of any business' email marketing strategy because it introduces your brand and sets the tone & expectations for your new subscribers.

On average, welcome emails see an open rate of around 80% — their high engagement makes them one of the most effective messages you can send your audience. Let's walk through everything you need to know when setting up your Welcome Series.&#x20;

### Add/Remove emails

* To add more emails to your series, click on any of the 'plus' signs between the emails.

* To remove an email from your series, click on the trash icon at the bottom of the email you'd like to delete.

### Time Delay

Configure your time delay to determine how long your first email triggers after sign up, and how much of a delay there is between each subsequent email triggers. You can customize each email's time delay by number of minutes, hours, or days.

### Display

This setting allows you to restrict your Welcome Series to trigger for sign ups from specific display(s). The default setting is 'All Displays', which means that all sign ups will receive the series, regardless of which Privy display they sign up on. If you'd like to have different Welcome experiences for different displays, this is the setting you will want to leverage.

### Coupon

Attach a coupon code to your series. By default, none of the emails in the default series templates include a coupon code. However, if you want to attach a coupon code, you can [follow these instructions](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/content/coupon-codes#automations:~:text=To%20insert%20a%20coupon%20in%20your%20Automation%3A) to insert a code into your templates as you customize them!

<Warning>
  Only 1 coupon can be attached per email series.
</Warning>

## Customize your templates

To edit the appearance of each of your emails, click the Edit icon to access the email editor:

To edit the email's Subject Line and Preview Text, click to edit the bar at the top of the email editor. Click done to close the bar after making your changes:

Once you've made all your edits, click **Save**. Click **Back to series** to exit the editor and head back to your Welcome Series.
