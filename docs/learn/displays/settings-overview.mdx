Privy Convert has a wide range of settings so that you can customize when + how your displays trigger, to whom, and how your information is collected. In this article, we'll review where to find your settings, and break down what each condition means.

## Where can I find my displays' settings?

Head to [Convert > All Displays](https://dashboard.privy.com/displays). Select an existing display or create a new one. Head to the **Settings** step at the top of the editor.

## Basic Settings

### Triggers and Visibility

Determine how and when your display appears to your audience.

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/triggers-and-visibility.png" />

You have the option to choose one or more of the following **trigger** settings:

* Time on Page

* Show on scroll

* Show on exit intent

<Info>
  If you have more than one trigger setting selected, then whichever event happens first will cause the display to appear.
</Info>

<Warning>
  If you have no trigger settings selected, your display will not appear automatically for your audience. In this case, we recommend using a tab so visitors can manually trigger your display.
</Warning>

You have the option to choose one or more of the following **visibility** settings:

* Limit display appearance

* Automatically end the display after X signups

<Info>
  Limiting the display appearance will prevent the display from triggering again for a visitor until the specified time has passed. *Our default is always set to 1 day.*
</Info>

<Warning>
  Unchecking "Limit display appearance" means there will be **no limit** to how often a display will trigger in a session for your audience.
</Warning>

### Audience Targeting

Privy allows you to target displays by Customer Attributes, Shopping Activity, Website Behavior, and more. You can explore all available properties in depth below:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer Attributes" defaultOpen={false} icon="user-group">
    * **Country:** Target visitors based on the Country reported by the visitor's IP Address.

    * **Custom Fields:** Target contacts based on their Custom Field values, which can provided via an import or by signing up for a display. Learn more about Custom Fields.

    * **Language:** Target visitors based on the default language set in their browser. The values for this condition are language codes following the [BCP 47](https://www.techonthenet.com/js/language_tags.php) standard and written without the region subtag —for example, en for English, fr for French, or es for Spanish. 

    * **Postal Code:** Target contacts based on their postal code area. We support postal codes from the United States (5-Digit), the United Kingdom (Outward Code), Canada (3-Digit FSA), and Australia (4-Digit). Each unique postal code must be entered on its own line. 

    * **Region:** Target contacts based on their geographic region. This condition currently supports states from the United States, counties from the United Kingdom, provinces from Canada, and states/territories from Australia. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shopping Activity" defaultOpen={false} icon="cart-shopping">
    * **Cart Product IDs:** Target visitors based on whether or not specific Product ID(s) have been identified in their cart. *Available for accounts integrated with Shopify or BigCommerce.* 

    * **Cart Value:** Target visitors based on the current value in their cart. *Available for accounts integrated with BigCommerce, Shopify, Squarespace, or Weebly.*

    * **Display Seen:** Target visitors based on the displays that they have or have not seen. 

    * **Display Seen (this session):** Target visitors based on the displays they have or have not seen in this session. *A session is a group of interactions with your website within a given time frame. It expires after 30 minutes of inactivity.*

    * **Display Signed Up:** Target visitors based on which displays they have or have not signed up for. 

    * **Display Signed Up (this session):** Target visitors based on the displays they have or have not signed up for in this session. *A session is a group of interactions with your website within a given time frame. It expires after 30 minutes of inactivity.*

    * **Day of week:** Target visitors based on the day of their visit. 

    * **Device category:** Target visitors based on whether they are accessing your site on a Desktop or Mobile device. *Tablets are considered part of the mobile device category.* 

    * **Initial traffic type:** Target visitors based on the channel they used to reach your site for the first time (e.g., direct, paid, social, etc.). *A visitor's channel is determined by the UTM parameter(s) included in the link that led them to your site.* 

    * **Initial URL (all time):** Target visitors based on the URL of the first page that they landed on when first visiting your site.

    * **Initial URL (this session):** Target visitors based on the URL of the first page that they landed on when visiting your site this session. *A session expires after 30 minutes of inactivity.*

    * **Pageviews (all time):** Target visitors based on the total number of pageviews across all of their tracked sessions. 

    * **Pageviews (this session):** Target visitors based on the total number of pageviews across the current tracked session. 

    * **Referring URL:** Target visitors based on the page they were on immediately before viewing the current page. *This URL could be from one of your site pages or an external page.*

    * **Sessions Count:** Target visitors based on the number of unique times they've visited your website.

    * **Time of day:** Target visitors based on the time of their visit. 

    * **Traffic type:** Target visitors based on the channel they used to reach your site (e.g., Direct, Paid, Social, etc.). A visitor's channel is determined by the UTM parameter(s) included in the link that led them to your site. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Other" defaultOpen={false} icon="code">
    * **Custom JavaScript:** This allows you to create your own targeting rules using JavaScript. *This option is only recommended for advanced users and outside Privy Support's scope.*

    * **User identity:** Targets visitors based on whether they are known or unknown.&#x20;

      * A "Known" visitor has submitted their information via a display or store checkout, been tagged with a tracking cookie, and become a contact.&#x20;

      * An "Unknown" visitor has not provided their information and remains unidentified. They may or may not be associated with an anonymous tracking cookie. 
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

When adding multiple targeting conditions, you can use **AND** / **OR** logic to narrow down your audience and specify whether a visitor must **Match All** conditions (strict) or can **Match Any** condition (less strict). See the example below:

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/and-or-logic.png" />

On the left, you'll see that we're using **Match Any** logic, so visitors who either live in Massachusetts OR came to the site from a social channel will see the display. On the right, you'll see that we're using **Match All** logic which means visitors must live in Massachusetts AND come to the site from a social channel to see the display.

<Note>
  If you remove all Audience Targeting, your display will be visible to everyone on your site.
</Note>

### Scheduling

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/display-scheduling.png" />

You have two options when configuring the start and end dates of your display:

* **Ongoing:** As soon as you launch your display, it will be continuously active until you disable it.

* **Custom Dates:** Schedule your display to start and end automatically on a fixed schedule.

### Coupon

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/display-coupon.png" />

Attach a Coupon to your display so that it appears anywhere you are using the `{{ coupon.code }}` variable, such as your Thank You Page and After Sign Up Emails + Texts.

Select whether or not you'd like your Coupon to automatically apply to cart after they complete their sign up.

<Note>
  Your Coupon must be created in Privy in order to be attached to your display. [Learn more about creating and managing Coupons in Privy.](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/content/coupon-codes)
</Note>

## Advanced Settings

To expand and edit your display's advanced settings, click **Show Advanced Settings** at the bottom left of your screen.

### Sign Up Rules

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/sign-up-rules.png" />

You can select up to two options for restricting who may sign up for your display:

* **Limit 1 sign up per contact:** This prevents the same email address from signing up more than once on the same exact display. *This is recommended and enabled on every Privy template by default.*

* **New contacts only:** This prevents email addresses that are already on your list from being able to submit a new sign up.

<Note>
  If a contact is restricted from signing up due to the conditions above, they will see an error message letting them know that they have already signed up.
</Note>

### Opt-In

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/opt-in-setting.png" />

Choose between **Single Opt-In** and **Double Opt-In** for your display. *Single Opt-In is the default setting for each Privy template.* Choosing Double Opt-In is encouraged for building a high quality, engaged list; it requires new sign ups to confirm their subscription in their inbox. [Learn more.](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/contact-management/double-opt-in)

### Sync Integrations

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/sync-integrations-settings.png" />

If you are using an external email service provider and/or need to sync your sign ups to one of your Linked Accounts, make sure you add all necessary sync rules to your display(s) here. [Learn more about our supported Integrations.](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/integrations/overview-integrations)

### Profile Attributes
