Privy Convert has a wide range of settings so that you can customize when + how your displays trigger, to whom, and how your information is collected.

## Basic Settings

### Triggers and Visibility

Determine how and when your display appears to your audience.

You have the option to choose one or more of the following trigger settings:

* Time on Page

* Show on scroll

* Show on exit intent

<Info>
  If you have more than one trigger setting selected, then whichever event happens first will cause the display to appear.
</Info>

<Warning>
  If you have no trigger settings selected, your display will not appear automatically for your audience. In this case, we recommend using a tab so visitors can manually trigger your display.
</Warning>

You have the option to choose one or more of the following visibility settings:

* Limit display appearance

* Automatically end the display after X signups

<Info>
  Limiting the display appearance will prevent the display from triggering again for a visitor until the specified time has passed. *Our default is always set to 1 day.*
</Info>

<Warning>
  Unchecking "Limit display appearance" means there will be no limit to how often a display will trigger in a session for your audience.
