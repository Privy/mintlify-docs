## Basic Settings

### Triggers and Visibility

Determine how and when your display appears to your audience.

You have the option to choose one or more of the following trigger settings:

* Time on Page

* Show on scroll

* Show on exit intent

<Info>
  If you have more than one trigger setting selected, then whichever event happens first will cause the display to appear.
</Info>

<Warning>
  If you have no trigger settings selected, your display will not appear automatically for your audience. In this case, we recommend using a tab so visitors can manually trigger your display.
</Warning>

You have the option to choose one or more of the following visibility settings:

* Limit display appearance

* Automatically end the display after X signups

<Info>
  Limiting the display appearance will prevent the display from triggering again for a visitor until the specified time has passed. *Our default is always set to 1 day.*
</Info>

<Warning>
  Unchecking "Limit display appearance" means there will be no limit to how often a display will trigger in a session for your audience.
</Warning>

### Audience Targeting

Privy allows you to target displays by Customer Attributes, Shopping Activity, Website Behavior, and more. You can explore all available properties in depth below:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer Attributes" defaultOpen={false} icon="user-group">
    * **Country:** Target visitors based on the Country reported by the visitor's IP Address.

    * **Custom Fields:** Target contacts based on their Custom Field values, which can provided via an import or by signing up for a display. Learn more about Custom Fields.

    * **Language:** Target visitors based on the default language set in their browser. The values for this condition are language codes following the [BCP 47](https://www.techonthenet.com/js/language_tags.php) standard and written without the region subtag —for example, en for English, fr for French, or es for Spanish. 

    * **Postal Code:** Target contacts based on their postal code area. We support postal codes from the United States (5-Digit), the United Kingdom (Outward Code), Canada (3-Digit FSA), and Australia (4-Digit). Each unique postal code must be entered on its own line. 

    * **Region:** Target contacts based on their geographic region. This condition currently supports states from the United States, counties from the United Kingdom, provinces from Canada, and states/territories from Australia.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Other" defaultOpen={false} icon="code">
    * **Custom JavaScript:** This allows you to create your own targeting rules using JavaScript. *This option is only recommended for advanced users and outside Privy Support's scope.*

    * **User identity:** Targets visitors based on whether they are known or unknown.&#x20;

      * A "Known" visitor has submitted their information via a display or store checkout, been tagged with a tracking cookie, and become a contact.&#x20;

      * An "Unknown" visitor has not provided their information and remains unidentified. They may or may not be associated with an anonymous tracking cookie. 
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

When adding multiple targeting conditions, you can use **AND** / **OR** logic to narrow down your audience and specify whether a visitor must **Match All** conditions (strict) or can **Match Any** condition (less strict). See the example below:

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/and-or-logic.png" />

On the left, you'll see that we're using **Match Any** logic, so visitors who either live in Massachusetts OR came to the site from a social channel will see the display. On the right, you'll see that we're using **Match All** logic which means visitors must live in Massachusetts AND come to the site from a social channel to see the display.
