When customizing your displays, you have the ability to add new elements (i.e., images or countdown timers) and new form fields (i.e., Name or Phone Number) to capture important information at sign up. This article will walk you through each element and form field supported by Privy, how to add them to your display, and your options for customizing them.

# Form Fields

Form fields collect information from your contacts as they sign up so that you can engage with your audience via the correct channels and personalize your content whenever possible! Learn more about Privy's supported form fields below.

## Adding and managing form fields

To add a new form field on your display:

* Head to [Convert > All Displays](https://dashboard.privy.com/displays). Select an existing display or [create a new one](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/displays/create-a-display).

* In the editor, hover over the elements on your display and click the blue 'plus' icon to add a new form field.

* Select your desired option from the menu.&#x20;

<Tip>
  Once you've added a new form field, you can head to the **Style** settings on the right and select **Match Styles** to quickly copy the same appearance as your existing form fields!
</Tip>



To move your form field, simply drag and drop it around your display. To delete a form field, click directly on the desired field(s) and click the delete icon.

## Customizing form fields

To customize a form field's settings and appearance, click directly on the form field you want to edit. Its settings will open up on the right:

* **Form field:** this will appear as the name of the form field you selected (i.e., Email or Mini Quiz). Choose whether or not this field is required and how it maps to your contact's profile.

* **Style:** customize your field's border, fill color, sizing, and spacing.

* **Text:** customize your placeholder text, font, size, color, and alignment.

* **Block:** customize the padding/spacing between your form field and other elements.

### Email

Email is one of Privy's default form fields. It collects the contact's primary email address.

<Warning>
  Either an email OR a phone number field is required when collecting sign ups so that a new contact profile can be created, or an existing contact profile can be updated with the new sign up activity.
</Warning>

### Phone

Phone is one of Privy's default form fields. It collects the contact's primary phone number.

<Note>
  By default, an SMS Opt-In field is added when you add a new Phone field. If you are not collecting contacts for SMS Marketing, you can delete the SMS Opt-In language.
</Note>

### SMS Opt-In

The SMS Opt-In field is a legal disclaimer required when collecting SMS contacts.

<Warning>
  Any phone numbers collected without access to Privy Text, a verified toll-free number, or the SMS Opt-In form field will not be considered textable in Privy. [Learn more about SMS Consent here.](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/compliance/understand-sms-consent)
</Warning>

### Name

Collect your contact's full name, or first or last name only. This field is perfect if you're looking to [personalize your email content](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/content/personalization-tags)!

### Checkbox

A checkbox enables you to collect custom fields at sign up — custom fields are stored in your contact's profile and can be used in segmentation. Checkboxes are perfect for when a contact might need to select multiple options (select all that apply).

### Radio Button

A radio button enables you to collect custom fields at sign up — custom fields are stored in your contact's profile and can be used in segmentation. Radio buttons are ideal for when you need a contact to select only one option.

### Mini Quiz

A mini quiz enables you to collect custom fields at sign up — custom fields are stored in your contact's profile and can be used in segmentation.

They can greatly influence how your traffic responds when they see your display. Below are the elements supported by Privy today. *Click on an element to jump ahead to its section in the article.*
