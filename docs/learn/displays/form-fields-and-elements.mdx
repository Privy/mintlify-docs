When customizing your displays, you have the ability to add new elements (i.e., images or countdown timers) and new form fields (i.e., Name or Phone Number) to capture important information at sign up. This article will walk you through each element and form field supported by Privy, how to add them to your display, and your options for customizing them.

## Form Fields

Form fields collect information from your contacts as they sign up so that you can engage with your audience via the correct channels and personalize your content whenever possible! Learn more about Privy's supported form fields below.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Email" defaultOpen={false}>
    Collect your contact's primary email address. This is one of Privy's default form fields.



    <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" /> **Note**: Either an email OR a phone number field is required when collecting sign ups so that a new contact profile can be created, or an existing contact profile can be updated with the new sign up activity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phone" defaultOpen={false}>
    Collect your contact's primary phone number. This is one of Privy's default form fields.



    <Icon icon="circle-info" /> **Note:** By default, an SMS Opt-In field is added when you add a new Phone field. If you are not collecting contacts for SMS Marketing, you can delete the SMS Opt-In language.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SMS Opt-In" defaultOpen={false}>
    The SMS Opt-In field is a legal disclaimer required when collecting SMS contacts.



    <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" /> **Note:** Any phone numbers collected without access to Privy Text, a verified toll-free number, or the SMS Opt-In form field will not be considered textable in Privy.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Name" defaultOpen={false}>
    Collect your contact's full name, or first or last name only. This field is perfect if you're looking to [personalize your email content](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/content/personalization-tags)!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Checkbox" defaultOpen={false}>
    A checkbox enables you to collect custom fields at sign up — custom fields are stored in your contact's profile and can be used in segmentation.&#x20;



    <Icon icon="lightbulb-on" /> Checkboxes are perfect for when a contact might need to choose multiple options (select all that apply).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Radio Button" defaultOpen={false}>
    A radio button enables you to collect custom fields at sign up — custom fields are stored in your contact's profile and can be used in segmentation.&#x20;



    <Icon icon="lightbulb-on" /> Radio buttons are ideal for when you need a contact to select only one option.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mini Quiz" defaultOpen={false}>
    A mini quiz enables you to collect custom fields at sign up — custom fields are stored in your contact's profile and can be used in segmentation.



    <Icon icon="lightbulb-on" /> Mini quizzes are a fun way to make your displays interactive! They work similarly to radio buttons (best for single-select), but with a modern twist. They are most effective when used as the first step in a Multi-step display, because they can seamlessly transition to the next step on-click.

## Elements

Elements allow you to customize your display's appearance to communicate clearly with your visitors and encourage them to take action. They can greatly influence how your traffic responds when they see your display. Below are the elements supported by Privy today. *Click on an element to jump ahead to its section in the article.*
