**Ready to start growing your list?** The best place to start is a Welcome Display, which incentivizes new visitors to sign up shortly after they arrive to your site. The following guide will walk you through how to create a sign-up display in Privy so that you can start driving revenue right away.

## Choose a Template

To get started, head to **Convert > All Displays** and click "New display".&#x20;

Select which Template you'd like to start with and click "Get started" to open the display editor.

## Create your display

Once you've chosen your Template, it's time to make it look and feel like your brand. Under the **Create** step, you can customize your display's appearance and add new elements.

## Target the right audience

When you're happy with your display's design, you'll want to head over to **Settings** to make sure it's showing to the right people at the right time. Privy will have our default best practices in place, but you're more than welcome to tweak them to fit your business' needs.

* **Triggers and Visibility** determines when and how the display appears for the visitor.

* **Audience Targeting** allows you to specify what visitors will be able to see the display.

* **Scheduling** determines how long the display will run for.

* The **Coupon** setting allows you to attach a coupon code that you would like to deliver to new sign-ups. Learn more about Coupon Codes.

### Advanced Settings

Our Advanced Settings allow you to have even more control over your display's behavior:

* **Sign Up Rules** control how often a contact can sign up for your display. *By default, this is set to limit 1 signup per contact.*

* The **Opt-In** setting allows you to choose between our Single Opt-In and Double Opt-In methods. *By default, this is set to Single Opt-In.* Learn more about Double Opt-In here.

* Use the **Sync Integrations** setting to automatically sync your sign ups to your preferred ESP.

* **Profile Attributes** allows you to automatically collect data from new sign ups, without needing them to fill out a form field. Learn more.

## Set up After Sign Up Emails and Texts

In the **Follow-Up** step, you will have the optional (but recommended) actions of creating and publishing After Sign Up emails and texts. This is a great way to confirm your new contact's sign up and deliver their coupon code.

## Launch your display

Once you've created your display, customized your settings, and reviewed your follow-up actions, it's time to make it live on your site. Click **Activate** and get ready to start seeing results!
