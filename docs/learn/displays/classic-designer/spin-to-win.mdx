### Add new elements

To add a new text box or image, click **+ Add new element** on the left.

### Edit existing elements

To edit existing elements, click directly on them in your display. You can edit their settings, duplicate, or delete the element on the left.

Under your *Elements* on the left, you can drag your elements to reorder them and edit your display's background, wheel, and desktop and mobile tabs.



## Edit your wheel

In the display editor, select **Wheel** under your *Elements***** to customize your wheel's colors, text, and coupon settings.

Select **Configure slices** to edit each slice of your Spin To Win's wheel:

* **Label:** this is the text that appears on the wheel itself. You can edit both winning and losing slices.

* **Coupon:** the coupon that is revealed when a sign up lands on this slice.

* **Win Ratio:** the likelihood of landing on a slice.

* **Win Text:** the text displayed after landing on this slice. This should specify which prize is associated with the coupon that the sign up won.

### Attach your Coupon Codes

One of the most important parts of creating your Spin To Win is attaching your Coupon Codes to your wheel. You can choose between manually entering **Custom** coupon codes, or attaching **Saved** coupons that have [already been created in your Privy account](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/content/coupon-codes).

<Warning>
  Custom coupons must be Master codes and must be created in your e-commerce platform in order to be valid in your store. You need to manually enter the Master code in each wheel slice. Custom coupons are only recommended to stores where Saved coupons are not a viable option.
</Warning>

To attach a Saved coupon:

* Select **Configure slices** and choose **Saved coupon** from the dropdown under *Coupon*.

* Choose the desired coupon from the following dropdown menu.&#x20;

* Repeat for each of your slices. Make sure your Label and Win Text match the coupon you've chosen.

* Scroll and click **OK** to save your changes.
