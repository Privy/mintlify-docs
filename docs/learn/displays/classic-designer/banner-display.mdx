A Banner display appears from the top or bottom of the web page and can remain visible as your visitors navigate around. The dynamic movement is a great way to get your visitors' attention. Simultaneously, the larger display size of a Banner allows you to incorporate an image or multi-field form element, unlike a more streamlined [Bar display](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/displays/classic-designer/bar-display).

## Create a new Banner

To create a new Banner:

* Navigate to [Convert > All Displays](https://dashboard.privy.com/displays).

* Click **Create new display**. This will open our Templates page.

* Our Embedded Forms need to be built using our Classic display builder, so navigate to this builder by selecting the **Get started** option in the lower left corner of your screen.

* Name your display in the following prompt, specify whether you want to collect email, phone, or both, and select **Create display**.

In the *Create* step of the Classic display builder, you can click to edit:

* **Form Fields:** what information you want to collect at sign up.

* **Compliance:** whether you want new sign ups to go through a Single Opt-In or Double Opt-In process.

* **Validations:** set any rules to restrict who may sign up for your display.

* On the following screen, select **Banner** from the left side. Browse the templates and choose which one you’d like to start with. Press **Choose selected** in the upper right corner to open the designer.

## Customize your Banner

Now that you’ve selected a template to start from, it’s time to customize your display’s appearance.

### Add elements

To add a text box, click **+ Add new element** on the left.

### Edit existing elements

To edit existing elements, click directly on them in your display, or select them from the menu on the left. You can edit their settings, duplicate, or delete the element on the left.

Under your *Elements* on the left, you can also edit your banner's background color, and desktop and mobile tabs.

Once you’re happy with your design, press **Save & Close** in the upper right corner.

## Customize your Thank You Page

After saving your changes, you’ll be brought back to the *Create* step of your display builder. If you’re collecting sign ups with your Banner, you’ll want to customize its Thank You Page to confirm your contact’s sign up.

* Scroll down and click to edit your **Thank You Page Design**.

* If you’re offering a coupon code in exchange for a sign up, be sure to include the `{{ signup.coupon_code }}` merge tag on your Thank You Page.

## Edit your settings

### Attach a coupon

If you are offering a coupon code in exchange for a sign up, be sure to attach your coupon to your display:

* In your display’s *Create* step, scroll to edit the **Coupon** section and select the desired Coupon from the dropdown menu. **Save.**

### Targeting

To customize your Banner’s settings and audience targeting, navigate to the *Target* step of the builder:

<img height="200" src="/images/displays/banner-target.png" />

1. **When To Show It:** determine when and how your display triggers.

2. **Who To Show It To:** determine who is eligible to view your display.

3. **How Long To Show It:** specify whether this display should be Ongoing, or set to run on a fixed schedule.

## Edit your Follow-Up actions

Once you’ve finalized your settings and audience targeting, you’ll want to make sure that you’re properly following up with your new sign up. Head to the *Follow-Up* step of your builder.
