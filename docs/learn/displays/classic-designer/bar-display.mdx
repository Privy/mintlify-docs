A Bar display snaps to the top or bottom of your web page and can remain visible as your visitors navigate around. It’s a great way to get your visitors' attention without interrupting their experience, and it takes up less real estate than a Banner display would. This display is perfect for collecting a single field of information, such as an email address, or just displaying a promotional message like an ongoing sale.
