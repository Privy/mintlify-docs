A Landing Page is a standalone web page that is specifically designed to receive and convert traffic from sources outside of your website — they're great for linking in advertisements, your social media, and even for using at in-person events.&#x20;

Unlike a traditional web page, which typically encourages a visitor to explore additional content, a Landing Page is an entirely self-contained display designed with a single focus: convert the visitor into a lead.

## Create a new Landing Page

* Navigate to [Convert > All Displays](https://dashboard.privy.com/displays).

* Click **Create new display**. This will open our Templates page.

* Our Landing Page needs to be built using our Classic display builder, so navigate to this builder by selecting the **Get started** option in the lower left corner of your screen.

* Name your display in the following prompt, specify whether you want to collect email, phone, or both, and select **Create display**.

* In the *Create* step of the Classic display builder, you can click to edit:

  * **Form Fields:** what information you want to collect at sign up.

  * **Compliance:** whether you want new sign ups to go through a Single Opt-In or Double Opt-In process.

  * **Validations:** set any rules to restrict who may sign up for your display.

* Click to **Add a display**.

* On the following screen, select **Landing Page** from the left side. Browse the templates and choose which one you’d like to start with. Press **Choose selected** in the upper right corner to open the designer.

## Customize your Landing Page

Now that you’ve selected a template to start from, it’s time to customize your display’s appearance:

### Add new elements

To add a new text box or image, click **+ Add new element** on the left.

### Edit existing elements

To edit existing elements, click directly on them in your display. You can edit their settings, duplicate, or delete the element on the left.

Under your *Elements* on the left, you can drag your elements to reorder them and edit your display’s background color or image.

Once you're happy with your Landing Page's appearance, click **Save & Close** in the upper right corner.

## Customize your Thank You Page

After saving your changes, you’ll be brought back to the *Create* step of your display builder. You’ll want to customize your display’s Thank You Page to confirm your contact's sign up.

* Scroll down and click to edit your **Thank You Page Design**.

* If you're offering a coupon code in exchange for a sign up, be sure to include the `{{ signup.coupon_code }}` merge tag on your Thank You Page.

<Tip>
  **Want to redirect new contacts to your website after signing up?** Press **+ Add element** on the left to add a button. Paste your website's URL and customize your button.
</Tip>

## Edit your settings

### Attach a coupon code

If you are offering a coupon code in exchange for a sign up, be sure to attach your coupon to your display:

* In your display's *Create* step, scroll to edit the **Coupon** section and select the desired Coupon from the dropdown menu. **Save.**

### Targeting

Since a Landing Page only appears when it is visited, the only audience targeting option revolves around how long the page is available. If you would like the display to expire after a fixed period, move to the *Target* step and update the **How Long to Show It** setting.

## Edit your Follow-Up actions

Once you’ve finalized your settings and audience targeting, you’ll want to make sure that you’re properly following up with your new sign up. Head to the *Follow-Up* step of your builder.

## Launch your Landing Page

Once you’ve finalized your design, targeting, and follow-up actions, select the **Publish** button at the upper right of the *Follow-Up* step and confirm your decision in the prompt.

<Note>
  **Note:** The landing page URL will only show when the display is published. If you stop the display, the link will not appear until you have re-published it.
