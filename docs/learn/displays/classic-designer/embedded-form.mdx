An Embedded Form is a sign up for that is fixed directly or "embedded" onto the page of your website, unlike displays such as popups, flyouts, or Spin To Wins which associated with a display animation (i.e., sliding in or popping up) and trigger based on audience targeting conditions. Embedded Forms are perfect for website footers, or web pages where you consistently want an opportunity for visitors to sign up for your email list.

Create a new Embedded Form

To create a new Embedded Form:

* Navigate to [Convert > All Displays](https://dashboard.privy.com/displays).

* Click **Create new display**. This will open our Templates page.

* Our Embedded Forms need to be built using our Classic display builder, so navigate to this builder by selecting the **Get started** option in the lower left corner of your screen.

* Name your display in the following prompt, specify whether you want to collect email, phone, or both, and select **Create display**.

* In the *Create* step of the Classic display builder, you can click to edit:

  <img height="200" src="/images/displays/legacy-form-fields.png" />

  * **Form Fields:** what information you want to collect at sign up.

  * **Compliance:** whether you want new sign ups to go through a Single Opt-In or Double Opt-In process.

  * **Validations:** set any rules to restrict who may sign up for your display.

* Click to **Add a display**.

* On the following screen, select **Embedded Form** from the left side. Browse the templates and choose which one you’d like to start with. Press **Choose selected** in the upper right corner to open the designer.

## Customize your Embedded Form

Now that you’ve selected a template to start from, it’s time to customize your display’s appearance.

<Tip>
  With Embedded Forms, most people prefer to keep the design minimal in Privy so that it fits in with their site's theme.
</Tip>

### Add new elements

To add a text box, click **+ Add new element** on the left.

### Edit existing elements

To edit existing elements, click directly on them in your display. You can edit their settings, duplicate, or delete the element on the left.

Under your *Elements* on the left, you can drag your elements to reorder them and edit your form’s background.

Once you're happy with your design, press **Save & Close** in the upper right corner.

## Customize your Thank You Page

After saving your changes, you’ll be brought back to the *Create* step of your display builder. You’ll want to customize your display’s Thank You Page to confirm your contact’s sign up.

* Scroll down and click to edit your **Thank You Page Design**.

* If you’re offering a coupon code in exchange for a sign up, be sure to include the `{{ signup.coupon_code }}` merge tag on your Thank You Page.

## Edit your settings

### Attach a coupon code

If you are offering a coupon code in exchange for a sign up, be sure to attach your coupon to your display:

* In your display’s *Create* step, scroll to edit the **Coupon** section and select the desired Coupon from the dropdown menu. **Save.**

### Targeting

Since an Embedded Form only appears when someone visits the web page it's embedded on, the only audience targeting option revolves around how long the form is available. If you would like the display to expire after a fixed period, move to the *Target* step and update the **How Long to Show It** setting.

## Edit your Follow-Up actions

Once you’ve finalized your settings and audience targeting, you’ll want to make sure that you’re properly following up with your new sign up. Head to the *Follow-Up* step of your builder.
