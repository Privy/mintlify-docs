## What is a Free Shipping Bar?

A Free Shipping Bar is a display that sits at the top of your website and calculates the difference between a visitor's current shopping cart value and a predetermined free shipping threshold. The bar is visible throughout the visit and dynamically updates as the visitor's cart gets closer to the free shipping goal. This persistent reminder ensures your potential customer is always aware of the potential reward and encourages them to increase their order value to receive it.

<Warning>
  **Note:** This feature is only available to Privy accounts integrated with BigCommerce, Shopify, Squarespace, Weebly, and Wix storefronts.

## Customize your Free Shipping Bar

Now that you've selected your template, it's time to customize its appearance!

* Edit your bar's background color or image, border, sizing, and spacing on the right side.

* Click directly on the bar's text to edit it and customize the font, color, size, and alignment on the right side.

* On your final step, click directly on the button to customize its appearance and settings on the right side.

<Note>
  By default, your button is set to redirect shoppers to the checkout page once they reach the free shipping goal. This is recommended, but you can change this if needed.
</Note>

Make sure you customize each step of your Free Shipping Bar! You can navigate between steps at the bottom of the editor. Make sure to **Save** any changes.

<Tip>
  To save time, click the **Match Styles** feature to quickly and easily copy the styles from the step(s) you already customized!
</Tip>

## Edit your settings

When you’re happy with your display’s design, you’ll want to head over to **Settings** to set your free shipping goal and make sure it’s showing to the right people at the right time.

### Set your free shipping goal

Click to edit the **Cart Goal** card at the top of your settings. Enter your store's free shipping threshold. **Save.**

### Audience Targeting

By default, your Free Shipping Bar will be visible to all audiences and appear immediately on your site. This is recommended, since free shipping is a popular incentive that can encourage an interested visitor to purchase from you!

If you want to adjust your Free Shipping Bar's trigger settings, or restrict it from being visible to certain audiences, you can [learn more about Privy's targeting here](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/displays/settings-overview).

## Launch your Free Shipping Bar

Once you've customized your Free Shipping Bar's appearance and set your Cart Goal, you're ready to launch your display. Click **Activate** in the upper right corner.

<Tip>
  You can still make changes to your display’s appearance and settings once it is published by clicking **Update Live Display** in the editor.
</Tip>

## Review your Performance

After you activate your display, you can review its performance at any time in the **Reporting** tab. [Learn more about Privy Convert Reporting.](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/displays/reporting-overview)

<Warning>
  Since your Free Shipping Bar does not collect sign ups, only display Views will be available in reporting.
