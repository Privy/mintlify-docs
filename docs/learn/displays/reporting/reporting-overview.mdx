Once you've published displays in Privy, you can review a snapshot of your ongoing performance on your Privy Homepage, as well as the Reporting tab in your individual display(s).

## Reviewing Overall Performance

To start, head to **Convert > All Displays** to review your displays' performance in aggregate. The following information is available in this view:

1. **Display Views:** The total number of display views since account creation. A view is registered when the display loads on a visitor's screen.&#x20;

2. **Total Signups:** The total number of display signups since account creation. A sign-up is registered when a visitor submits their information via a display.Â 

3. **Total Orders:** The total number of orders since account creation. An order is registered when someone signs up for your Privy display and then completes a purchase through your store using the same email address. Privy counts an order regardless of whether or not the customer used a coupon code during checkout.&#x20;

4. **Display Revenue:** The total revenue collected from all contacts who signed up via a Privy display and subsequently made a purchase. This revenue attribution is only available to Privy accounts integrated with a Shopify or BigCommerce storefront.&#x20;
