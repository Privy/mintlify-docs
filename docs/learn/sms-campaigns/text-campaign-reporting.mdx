Once you've started sending text campaigns, you'll want to check in on their performance to track their revenue, engagement, and delivery. Below is a guide on how to find your text campaigns' reporting and how to interpret it.

## Campaigns Table

To get an overview of your text campaigns' metrics:

* Navigate to [Campaigns](https://dashboard.privy.com/message-campaigns).

* To narrow down your view of your Campaigns table, you can use the Search and Filter functions at the top of the table to narrow down by status and message type. *For example, if you only want to view your Sent text campaigns, you'll want to filter by Status: Sent and Type: SMS.*

In the top right, you'll find the total **Revenue Generated** for the Campaigns you're viewing in the table below. If you click the arrow next to your Revenue Generated, you'll see a dropdown including the total number of texts delivered since account creation.

If you take a look at the table, you’ll get a line-by-line view of each Campaign and their title, preview, status, and send date, along with the following metrics:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Delivered" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total number of text messages delivered to your recipient's phone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clicked" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total number of contacts who received your text message and clicked on your short link.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unsubscribed" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total number of contacts who received your text message and replied 'STOP' to unsubscribe from all future messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revenue" defaultOpen={false}>
    The total revenue collected from this text message. *Privy uses a last-touch model with a 7-day attribution window. If a customer has opened/clicked multiple emails and texts within the seven days proceeding a purchase, the revenue will only count toward the message they most recently engaged with.*
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Text Campaign Reporting Page

To take a deeper dive into an individual text message's engagement, delivery, and revenue:

* Navigate to [Campaigns](https://dashboard.privy.com/message-campaigns), locate and select the desired text campaign. This will open your text campaign's reporting page.

At the top of your screen, you'll see your text campaign's title, the segment and number of contacts it was sent to, it's send day/time, and the message type. A preview of the sent text will also appear.
