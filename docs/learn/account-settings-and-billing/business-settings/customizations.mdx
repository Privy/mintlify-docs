## Manage reCAPTCHA settings

reCAPTCHA is a service that protects your website from spam and abuse. reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive CAPTCHAs to keep automated software from engaging in abusive activities on your site. It does this while letting your valid visitors pass through with ease. 

### reCAPTCHA and Privy

Any form included in your Privy displays uses Google's [Invisible reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/versions). The "invisible" approach means that most of your visitors will submit a form without ever needing to complete a reCAPTCHA test. In the background, Google scans a visitor's behavior to determine whether this visitor is abusive, spammy, or a bot. If Google believes one of those is true, the visitor will see a reCAPTCHA test they must complete. 

### Enable or disable reCAPTCHA

To manage your reCAPTCHA settings:

* Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your *Business Settings*. 

* Scroll down and locate the *Invisible reCAPTCHA* section. 

* Check or uncheck the **Enable Invisible reCAPTCHA** checkbox and **Save**.

If reCAPTCHA is disabled via your account settings, Privy effectively vouches for your registration process and will attempt to waive all reCAPTCHA requirements. However, if behavioral analysis suspects that a user may be a bot or that spam activities are taking place, reCAPTCHA can still fire in the background. This aspect of reCAPTCHA cannot be disabled as it is currently one of the best ways to protect Privy merchants from suspicious or abusive activity.

## Enable Google Analytics

To enable the Google Analytics integration in your account:

* Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your *Business Settings*. 

* Scroll down until you reach the *Other Customizations* section. 

* Enable the **Enable Google Analytics** setting and **Save**.

<Note>
  **Note:** To use this feature, you must already have Google Analytics installed on your website, and it must be a Universal Analytics property. The installation cannot be done via Google Tag Manager. If you have any questions about installing Google Analytics, please visit [Google Analytics Support](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080). 
</Note>

Correct. Instead, Privy automatically detects the Google Analytics trackers on the pages that also include your Privy Convert displays. Whenever a Privy event is triggered, it will be fired for all of the detected Google Analytics trackers. For example, if you have trackers with tracking IDs of "UA-XXXXXXXX-1" and "UA-XXXXXXXX-2" installed on a page, Privy events will be fired for both.



### What information is available?

Once the integration is enabled, the following events will be available in Google Analytics: 

* Viewed displays (event action "viewed-campaign")

* New signups for a display (event action "new-signup") 

If you would like to customize the events or data beyond these default options, you will need to install a custom tracking code manually. 



## Install tracking codes & pixels

Privy supports a wide range of third-party tracking codes and pixels, including those from Google Analytics, Google Adwords, and Facebook Ads. These snippets from external tools work similarly to the Privy code. Once installed on your site, the tracking code or pixel detects site visits. This data becomes the basis for better understanding and addressing your customer behaviors. 

### Install your snippet

To install your third-party tracking code or pixel: 

* Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your *Business Settings*. 

* Paste your snippet into the appropriate field. A snippet placed in the *Tracking Pixels* section runs on all pages where a display is shown, while a snippet placed in the *Conversion Pixels* section runs on all pages where a user signs up for a display.

* Once you’ve added your snippet, select the **Save Changes** option at the bottom of the page.

### Customize your snippet

Personalization variables can be added to your snippets by selecting the **Add personalization variable** dropdown menu. These variables allow you to send additional data to compatible systems by populating the variable with the related information when the code or pixel fires. 

Customization of third-party codes and pixels is only recommended for advanced users. Changes to these snippets can easily prevent them from functioning correctly. The personalization variables use the open-source [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). 

<Warning>
  **Warning**: Contact data referenced in custom conversion JavaScript (JS) via variables is only available when collected (e.g., Form submission). Data collected from prior signups or imports will not be available. Additionally, variables are not supported for tracking JS snippets.
</Warning>

## Install a Facebook event code

To track contacts that visit your site from a Facebook ad and then sign up via a Privy form, you can install a [Facebook event code](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755?id=1205376682832142) on the pages that include your Privy Convert displays. The code will allow you to track these "leads" in your Facebook Ads account.

<Note>
  **Note:** To use Facebook event codes, you must have installed the Facebook Ads tracking pixel. Information on installing third-party pixels is available in the section above.
</Note>

### Copy the event code

To start triggering and tracking these events, you will need to copy this code:

```
<script>

fbq('track', 'Lead');

</script>
```

### Install the event code

To install the event code:

* Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your *Business Settings*. 

* Paste the copied event code into the **Conversion Pixels** area.  

* Select the **Save Changes** option at the bottom of the page.

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="fb-event-code" src="/images/business-settings/install-fb-event-code.mp4" />

<Note>
  **Note:** Privy will now fire the pixel after every new form submission. After around 24 hours, you should begin to see lead counts increment in Facebook ads. 
</Note>

## Install custom webhooks

If you're a developer, you can configure webhooks to send from Privy to an external system for signup and order events. 

To add, edit, or remove webhooks:

* Click on your Business Name in the upper right and select **Integrations** from the dropdown menu.

* Navigate to the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/webhooks) page under Integrations.

### Examples

Here is an example webhook payload for a signup event: 

```
{
    "id": 999999,

    "email": "test@example.com",

    "first_name": "Test",

    "last_name": "User",

    "custom_fields": null,

    "created_at": null,

    "updated_at": null,

    "display": {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Newsletter signup"
    }
} 
```

If the signup has custom fields, the custom\_fields will appear as a (single-level) nested object:

```
{

    "id": 999999,

    "email": "test@example.com",

    "first_name": "Test",

    "last_name": "User",

    "custom_fields": {

        "favorite_color": "blue"

     },

    "created_at": null,

    "updated_at": null,

    "display": {

        "id": 1,

        "title": "Newsletter signup"
    }
}
```

### Endpoint requirements

Your webhook endpoint must be a publicly accessible URL that resolves to an IP address in one of the public ranges. For example, you cannot use any URL that resolves to 127.0.0.1 or equivalent.

We recommend using HTTP basic authentication to add a layer of security to your webhook endpoint (e.g., [https://name:password@example.com/post](https://name:password@example.com/post) ). 

Your server will need to reply with an HTTP 200 response to let you know you've received the webhook. If it does not respond with an HTTP 200, Privy will not return the server's HTTP response code or response body to you for inspection.
