## Website Support Policy

**Initial install**: Installation documentation is available for various platforms, and the Support Team will provide as much guidance as possible to ensure Privy is installed properly. However, the Support Team will not edit your site code directly. Instead, the team will refer you to your website platform's support documentation or channels for specific questions about your site code. 

**Website conflicts**: Privy regularly invests engineering resources to ensure that Privy runs optimally on your website and does not interfere with common website functions. Please note that conflicts with site styling (CSS) and custom JavaScript (JS) are possible. The Support Team will do its best to help you identify these possible conflicts but will not edit your site code directly. Instead, the team will refer you to check with your website developer for a sustainable resolution. 

## Integrated Vendor Policy

Privy integrates with many different platforms and services. The platforms that integrate with Privy typically provide their own support documentation that can be referenced should an issue arise. Privy will offer support around those integrations only as they relate to Privy-specific functionality. 

Additionally, issues resulting from your use of APIs or other code modifications may be outside the scope of support. 

## Policies and Legal Documents

To reflect a constantly changing legislative landscape, Privy routinely updates the company's various service documents. The most recent versions are linked below. Please review these documents to ensure that your business remains compliant while using Privy services. 

* [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.privy.com/acceptable-use-policy)

* [Data Processing Addendum](https://www.privy.com/data-processing-addendum)

## ADA Compliance

The Department of Justice (DOJ) published the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) - Standards for Accessible Design in September 2010. These standards state that all electronic and information technology must be accessible to people with disabilities.

Privy strives to stay compliant and is making changes to become more ADA-compliant to enable all who interact with Privy displays to navigate them easily. The following Privy display types are considered dialogs or modals for ADA compliance: 

* Popups

* Flyouts

* Banners

* Spin-To-Win

* Thank You Displays

<Note>
  **Note:** Bars, embedded forms, and landing pages are not considered dialogs or modals. 
</Note>

Privy has empowered users to adhere to ADA compliance regulations for these dialogs/modals by:&#x20;

* Site visitors can identify your Privy display as a separate modal, focus on the text in the display, and close the display.

* Site visitors can use the tab button to navigate the display's elements (e.g., text, form fields, buttons).

* Written context is given to identify and clarify the form fields (e.g., email, phone, text, etc.).

* Site visitors can interact with or select answers to different forms or buttons/links (checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and links).&#x20;

* Privy continues to strive for further compliance and will be continuing to make improvements to become more compliant. If you have further questions about this, please don't hesitate to contact the Privy team at [research@privy.com](mailto:research@privy.com).

<Accordion title="Compliance tips for your design" defaultOpen={false}>
  Users, including users with visual disabilities, must be able to perceive the content you are showing. WCAG requires "at least 4.5:1" contrast, where contrast measures the difference in perceived "luminance" or brightness between two colors. 



  Below is an excerpt from [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/) (Web Accessibility in Mind) that shows four examples with the minimum 4.5:1 contrast requirement for WCAG compliance. Privy recommends you meet or exceed the following for contrast and color in your onsite displays and email designs.



  Here is a website to [help you determine the contrast ratio](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure your text's readability. These contrast requirements also apply to the text within a graphic, called "images of text," the contrast and readability of text can also be affected by the size, fonts, hover states, and more. 
</Accordion>

For more information about web accessibility, visit the [Web Accessibility Initiative website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/).

## Supported Browsers

A supported web browser is required to utilize Privy's full set of features properly. Some features might not behave as expected if you are using Privy on an older or unsupported browser. 

<Note>
  **Note:** These requirements apply to the use of the Privy platform and your public-facing content. The browser and email client support for content created in and hosted by Privy will vary depending on the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used in your emails or on your website. 
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Windows-supported Browsers" defaultOpen={false}>
    * Google Chrome (latest version)

    * Mozilla Firefox (latest version)

    * Microsoft Edge (latest version)

    * Internet Explorer 11\* 

    <Note>
      \* Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Edge as your default browser and supports Internet Explorer 11 as part of its backward compatibility efforts. Privy should continue to function correctly while this support continues; however, we cannot guarantee how Privy will perform in this particular browser. That said, Microsoft no longer [provides updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge) for earlier versions of Internet Explorer, and Privy does not support these. 
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mac-supported Browsers" defaultOpen={false}>
    * Google Chrome (latest version)

    * Safari (latest version)

    * Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

It's best to keep your browsers updated to the latest version. Not only does this ensure that you can expect Privy to work as expected, but also ensures that your web browsing experience is better overall. To update a supported browser, please refer to their documentation:

* [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en&__hstc=20629287.c1ffb9eee722387561972ebc9ec07e17.1583245382856.1590098325284.1590180118068.41&__hssc=20629287.1.1590180118068&__hsfp=2642571461)

* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version)

* [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416)

* [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge)

## Privy and Website Speed

Most users do not see a noticeable impact on their site performance when Privy is installed. This is because Privy aims to remain as lightweight as possible regardless of your installation method. That said, Privy offers both synchronous and asynchronous code options to provide the best compatibility with your site, and these code formats impact site performance differently. 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimization + hosting" defaultOpen={false}>
    The Privy engineering team is constantly working to optimize the load times and file sizes associated with the widget used to display your Privy displays. Additionally, each iteration of the widget references assets in a world-class content delivery network (CDN) with an average response time of under 10 milliseconds. To learn more about the benefits of a CDN, click [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/performance/). 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Installation method" defaultOpen={false}>
    **Synchronous code** - This is the recommended option for a manual install of Privy. Synchronous code is executed in sequence wherein each statement waits for the previous statement to finish before executing. This code format allows the installer to determine the relative order of code execution on their site, which means Privy could load faster or slower based on the site's configuration. 



    **Asynchronous code** - This is the default option when Privy is installed on your site via an integration such as Shopify or Wix. This code format yields to your site, loading as passively as possible, always giving your site precedence. It does not block any content or scripts on your page from loading. This means Privy’s assets are not placed on the critical render path for your site. While web page analysis tools may show that Privy loads later than other resources, this is entirely intentional. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I evaluate Privy's impact?" defaultOpen={false}>
    <Warning>
      **Note:** Familiarity with Google Chrome's developer tools is recommended. 
    </Warning>

    To review and better understand Privy's impact on your site performance: 

    * Using Google Chrome, navigate to a site page that includes the Privy code. 

    * Open the browser's DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+J (PC) or Command+Option+J (Mac). 

    * Switch to the **Network** tab and then reload the page. 

    * As the page loads, the tab will populate with information. Each row represents a resource. By default, the resources are listed chronologically. 

    * Locate the **Widget.JS** resource to review its information. The most relevant information concerning performance is Status (Did the widget load properly with a 200 OK?), Time (How long did the widget take to load?), and Waterfall placement (When did it load? Did it allow other more important resources to take precedence?). 

    To learn more about using this tool for performance evaluation, click [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network).

## Submit Feedback to Privy

Customer feedback is invaluable at Privy. While our team members are the ones developing, selling, and supporting the software, our customers are the ones using the tools to attract millions of leads, generate billions of dollars, and build successful businesses.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is feedback used?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Getting customer input throughout the development process is very important as it is one of the best ways to ensure that product changes add value for real customers. More specifically, customer feedback is reflected in three primary ways: 

    1. **Fresh ideas and fixes** - Customers frequently push the Privy product to its limits. The out-of-the-box thinking and creative workarounds used to make their lives easier and their operations more effective are perfect opportunities for improvement. Furthermore, as consistent users of the product, customers are keenly aware of issues that may be unknown or difficult to replicate and should be addressed in future updates. 

    2. **Validation for current initiative** - The team here at Privy does their best to understand customers' needs, but industry trends, research, and best intentions only go so far. Real, passionate customer feedback helps push the team forward or recalibrate when necessary. 

    3. **Start conversations** - The Privy feedback options (see below) help the team identify customers with specific situations, challenges, or opportunities in need of additional exploration. These conversations help make the platform better for all users by driving development forward. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I share feedback?" defaultOpen={false}>
    The easiest and most direct way to provide product feedback is in-app:

    * **Use the "Help" menu** - While you're logged into Privy, select **Help** > **Feedback** from the main navigation. This action opens a prompt that submits feedback directly to the team. 

    There are also a variety of other channels to ensure your feedback is heard:

    * **Talk to Support** - [Email Support](mailto:support@privy.com) if you're having any issues with the product. 

    * **Talk to your Customer Success Manager** - Managed accounts are encouraged to provide feedback to their CSMs. They can often provide more context on an identified opportunity or challenge and pass along your feedback to the product team when needed. 

    * **Participate in Betas** - Privy customers occasionally receive invitations to participate in betas to test out new features. If you're interested in providing feedback that directly affects ongoing product development, consider opting into one of these betas. 

    * **Participate in Design Testing or Feedback Sessions** - Design tests let you experiment with mockups and prototypes of features in development. Meanwhile, feedback sessions allow you to interface with members of the Privy team to deep-dive into specific product areas.
