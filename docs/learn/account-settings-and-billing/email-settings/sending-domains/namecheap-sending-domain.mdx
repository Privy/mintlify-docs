To improve & maintain deliverability and build trust with your email recipients, you should be sending your emails from your brand's custom sending domain in Privy. This resource will walk you through the steps on how to set up your DNS records with Namecheap. If you use a different provider, please see [this resource](https://privy.mintlify.app/docs/learn/deliverability/use-a-custom-sending-domain).

**​Please ensure that you meet the following requirements before proceeding:** 

* You must own a domain name — addresses from free providers like Gmail or Yahoo won’t work.

* You must have the ability to update the DNS records of your domain.

* You must be hosting a website at the root of the domain.
