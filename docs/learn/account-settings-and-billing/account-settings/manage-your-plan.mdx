### Cancel a plan

To cancel an existing plan:

* Navigate to the [My Plan & Billing](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/billing) page in your Privy account. 

* Select the appropriate **Cancel** button next to the desired plan.

<Warning>
  **Note:** If you cancel a plan, you will immediately lose access to the associated paid features. For more information, see Privy's [terms of service](https://privy.com/terms-and-conditions) and [refund policy](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/account-settings-and-billing/account-settings/billing-payments-and-refunds#refund-policy).
</Warning>

It is important to note that each of these plans must be managed separately and are not automatically canceled if you uninstall the application. In particular:

* Downgrading one plan does not automatically cancel or downgrade your other plan(s).

* Downgrading or canceling your connected e-commerce store (e.g., BigCommerce, Shopify, or Wix) does not automatically cancel your Privy plan(s).

* Uninstalling or removing Privy from your store does not automatically cancel your plan(s).

If you choose to cancel all of your Privy products, your account will remain active on a non-paid subscription, and its information will be maintained unless the account is closed or deleted. 

### Close your account

To close your Privy account, navigate to your [Business Information](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/business-info) page and click the **Close Account** button. When closing an account, please note:

* Closing an account is not reversible.

* If you are on a paid plan when closing an account, Privy will attempt to cancel it automatically. 

* You must close each account separately if your profile is attached to multiple businesses.

### Delete your account

Privy has a process for honoring data subject requests related to various compliance frameworks, including [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) and [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/). To request an account deletion in accordance with these frameworks: 

* Start an email to [support@privy.com](mailto:support@privy.com). 

* Provide your email address. It must be associated with a user in the Privy account. 

* Use "Compliance - Data Removal Request" as the subject line.

  * The *Business Name* and *Website URL* are listed in your Privy account [here](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/business-info).

* Select the **Submit** button. 

Following the submission, all of the account's identifiable information will be scrubbed within 30 days. Once the information is removed, it cannot be restored.
