</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Note:** The above plans reflect Privy's updated subscription model as of June 21, 2025. If you activated a subscription plan before June 21, 2025, please reference this page for more information on your plan.
</Warning>

If you're looking to make any changes to your subscription plan, [check out this guide](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/account-settings-and-billing/account-settings/manage-your-plan).

Privy maintains a pricing page [here](https://www.privy.com/pricing). By using the Privy service, you agree to pay Privy the amount set forth on the pricing page for the particular Privy service to which you are subscribing. Privy will provide you with fourteen (14) days advance notice of any pricing changes via email, and your continued use of the Privy service following such notice period will constitute your acceptance of these changes.

### Trial

You can start a free trial by [creating an account](https://dashboard.privy.com/users/sign_up?utm_source=knowledgebase&utm_medium=articleutm_campaign=knowledgebase) or adding the Privy app to your [BigCommerce](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/61-install-privy-on-bigcommerce), [Shopify](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/65-install-privy-on-shopify), or [Wix](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/109-install-privy-on-wix) store. The trial provides access to:

- Privy Displays, with no features or traffic limitations for 15 days. 
- Privy Email, with a 100-person send limit per day for 15 days.

/>

That means you can install Privy, launch targeted displays with automated after signup messages, capture as much contact information as you want, and start nurturing those relationships via email. 

<Icon icon="circle-question" /> **What happens after my trial ends?**

You will be unable to use Privy after your 15-day trial ends, unless you upgrade to a paid plan. Any existing displays will be deactivated and not shown to website visitors. Any active automations will stop and no longer trigger.

### Email \+ SMS Plan

The Email \+ SMS subscription plan is based on the number of mailable contacts \+ the number of SMS credits you're subscribed to. This plan includes unlimited email sends, as well as 250 free SMS credits each month, which do not roll over.

<Icon icon="envelope" /> **Email Pricing**

Privy Email pricing is based on the number of mailable contacts in your account. The first tier starts at \$30 for up to 1,500 contacts. Once you exceed 1,500 contacts, the pricing scales as follows:

- 1,501 - 2,000 mailable contacts: scales \$15 for every 500 contacts
- 2,001 - 25,000 mailable contacts: scales \$15 for every 1,000 contacts
- 25,001 - 100,000 mailable contacts: scales \$30 for every 5,000 contacts
- 100,001\+ mailable contacts: scales \$60 for every 10,000 contacts

<Icon icon="mobile" /> **SMS Add-on Pricing**

In addition to emails, you can purchase a monthly SMS credit subscription. Your SMS credit subscription will auto-renew each month so that you always have enough to send to your audience.

Credit cost will be dependent on the recipient's location (US or CA), the length of the SMS message (# of characters), and whether or not the message is MMS (includes images). 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I know how many credits to purchase?" icon="circle-question">
    [**We offer a tool on our website**](https://www.privy.com/pricing) to help determine how many credits would be sufficient for your business based on how many contacts you have, where they're located, how often you send, and what types of messages you plan on sending.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I don't use all my credits?" icon="circle-question">
    Any unused credits will roll over to the next billing cycle, but expire 60 days after purchase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of credits in the middle of my billing cycle?" icon="circle-question">
    Without sufficient SMS credits, you will not be able to send SMS or MMS campaigns and automations will not trigger. You can upgrade to the next tier at any time to purchase more SMS credits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do SMS credits expire?" icon="circle-question">
    Yes, SMS credits will expire 60 days after purchase.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Displays Plan

The Displays Plan uses a tiered pricing model based on the average pageviews per month that your website receives. The base plan is \$24/month and includes up to 10,000 pageviews. This plan does not include access to Privy's email or text message features.

## Billing FAQs

Find answers to common questions about the billing process for your account. 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What currency does Privy use for billing?" defaultOpen="false">
    Privy bills customers in United States Dollars (USD). 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I pay for Privy?" defaultOpen="false">
    Privy's plans can be paid for through your [Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/manage-billing/your-invoice) account or via credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover).

    Credit card payments are processed using Stripe. For more information about the strict security measures that Stripe uses, please see the [Stripe Security Page](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe). 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I update my payment information?" defaultOpen="false">
    In your Privy dashboard, click on **Settings** in the lower left, then head to the [Plans and Pricing](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/billing) page, and scroll down to _Payment method_.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I access my invoices?" defaultOpen="false">
    In your Privy dashboard, click on **Settings** in the lower left, then head to the [Plans and Pricing](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/billing) option from the dropdown menu, and scroll down to _Invoices_. Here you'll find your last 12 invoices with credit card billing. If you need older invoices, please email [billing@privy.com](mailto:billing@privy.com) and request them. 

    <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" /> **Note:** If you are billed via Shopify, your invoices will be on the Shopify platform. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When will I be charged?" defaultOpen="false">
    **Shopify**: Payments processed via Shopify will be included in your next Shopify bill. 

    **Credit Card**: Payments processed via credit card will be charged immediately for the first invoice, any plan changes thereafter will be reflected on your next billing date.

    For example, if your first payment was on March 1st, your next payment will be on April 1st and the 1st of every month going forward. This billing cycle will continue until the plan is canceled. Once you make the change to your upgraded plan, you will have access to those features immediately, regardless of a mid-cycle change. 

    <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" /> **Note:** These guidelines do not apply to accounts on annual or bundled plans. The payment schedule for those plans will be specified in your agreement. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does contact autoscaling work?" defaultOpen="false">
    Privy bills you based on the highest number of mailable/textable contacts in your account for each billing cycle. If an account reaches the contact limit of one of its Privy plans, you'll automatically be upgraded to the next tier, which will be reflected in your next billing cycle.

    Conversely, if the account drops below a previous contact limit, you'll automatically be moved to a lower tier. No notification is sent, and no action is required from the account owner. 

    Check out [this resource ](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/account-settings-and-billing/account-settings/manage-your-plan)to make changes to your Privy plans. If you choose to cancel a plan mid-cycle, you will lose access to any paid features associated with that plan immediately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My Shopify bill has two charges. Why?" defaultOpen="false">
    Your Shopify bill, as managed by Privy, may appear as two separate charges—a base charge and a usage charge. This division sometimes confuses users, making them believe they're being charged twice. Rest assured, this isn't the case.

    Shopify separates the base charge of a plan from any additional pricing associated with specific usage tiers. For example, a merchant on the \$90 Starter plan will see a base charge of \$15 and a usage fee of \$75. Usage in Privy is not related to the features used or the use of the account; usage in Privy is related to the number of mailable contacts on the account and how they scale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failed Payment Banner" defaultOpen="false">
    In the event that Privy is unable to process your most recent payment, an account status banner will be placed within your account, directing you to take action in the [**My Plans and Pricing**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/billing) section. The banner will remain in place on the account until the failed payment has been successfully reconciled.

## Refund Policy

The billing team reviews all refund requests on a case-by-case basis. A transaction is refund-eligible for ten (10) days, with the review period starting on the initial charge date. Please note that exceptions to this policy are made on a case-by-case basis. If you believe your situation warrants special consideration, please contact our customer support team, and we will do our best to assist you.

Specific instances where a refund is not required or will not be issued include: 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upgrades or Downgrades" defaultOpen="false">
    If you decide to switch plans mid-cycle, a refund is not required. Should you need to change plans midcycle, simply reach out to us at [billing@privy.com](mailto:billing@privy.com), and we will help ensure you are not double billed. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account Inactivity" defaultOpen="false">
    Privy is not automatically canceled if the account isn't being used or is uninstalled from your website/storefront, the store is closed, or there is any instance where the account is not going to be used for a period of time. If Privy no longer meets your business needs, or you are not planning to use Privy for some time, please [cancel](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/account-settings-and-billing/account-settings/manage-your-plan#cancel-a-plan) the desired individual plan or [close](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/account-settings-and-billing/account-settings/manage-your-plan#close-your-account) the account entirely to avoid additional charges. Failure to close your account or account properly or lack of usage will not result in a refund. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Annual Billing" defaultOpen="false">
    Annual billing provides customers with a discount by requiring an upfront payment. Due to the nature of this discount, Privy cannot extend refunds to subscriptions on annual billing. Any annual plan cannot be canceled or closed until the next annual renewal date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Promotional Rates" defaultOpen="false">
    Privy does not offer refunds on plans that are receiving a promotional discount. Additionally, the discounted rate only applies to the plan that is currently active. If the plan is upgraded to a more expensive plan, the promotion will no longer apply. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accidental Upgrades" defaultOpen="false">
    Privy has designed the upgrade path to include several steps, where a plan's pricing is clearly listed and where multiple actions must be taken to confirm the purchase decision. With this in mind, Privy does not offer a refund for a plan that was upgraded by following these steps. Please [cancel](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/account-settings-and-billing/account-settings/manage-your-plan#cancel-a-plan) the desired individual subscription or [close](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/account-settings-and-billing/account-settings/manage-your-plan#close-your-account) the account entirely to avoid additional charges.  
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Acceptable Use Policy" defaultOpen="false">
    If you engage in any of the activities listed in the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.privy.com/acceptable-use-policy), Privy reserves the right to terminate your access to or use of the Privy service, disable your Privy account or access to the Privy Service, and remove all or a portion of your content, in each case at any time, with or without notice and without refund. Privy may also report your activity to the applicable legal authorities or third parties for abuse or fraud prevention.
