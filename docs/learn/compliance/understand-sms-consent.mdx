SMS marketing is a highly regulated medium, so we’ve prepared this article to make sure that you understand all the requirements needed to collect textable phone numbers from your clients in a compliant manner, and answer any questions you might have around consent.

**Before we get into the details, make sure that you:**

<Icon icon="check" /> Are subscribed to Privy's Growth Plan, which includes access to all our SMS features.

<Icon icon="check" /> Have already registered for your toll-free number and been approved.

<Icon icon="check" /> Will only be collecting and sending messages to numbers in the United States and Canada (+1 country code)

## How do I collect SMS contacts?

At this time, the only way to collect SMS Contacts at Privy is to have them sign up via a Privy display. The display must include a phone number field and our SMS Opt-In legal disclaimer. Privy Convert Displays are included in your Growth Plan subscription.

To add a phone number field and SMS Opt-In legal disclaimer, you can either:

1. [Create a new display and select a template that Collects SMS Subscibers](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/displays/create-a-display#choose-a-template)
2. [Add a new phone number form field](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/displays/form-fields-and-elements#form-fields)
3. [Add a new phone number collection step](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/displays/create-a-display#add-and-delete-steps)

<Note>
  When you add a phone number form field with the SMS Opt-In disclaimer, be sure that you add your brand's Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions.

  \
  To do this, click on the SMS Opt-In disclaimer element, and paste the links to your own Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions into the fields on the right:

</Note>

Once signing up, contacts must also complete the Double Opt-In process to become a textable contact.&#x20;

## How does SMS Double Opt-In work?

To become a textable contact on your list, your contact must complete both parts of the Double Opt-In process:

<Icon icon="check" /> Signed up on a Privy display with their phone number and the SMS Opt-In legal disclaimer present.

<Icon icon="check" /> Replied 'Y' to the Double Opt-In message they receive immediately after signing up.

Here's what the Double Opt-In message from your business will look like:

Once the contact replies 'Y', they will officially be a textable contact on your list + receive all your messages moving forward!

If a contact does not reply 'Y', they will not be textable.

## How do contacts Unsubscribe and/or Resubscribe?

To unsubscribe, contacts need to reply STOP to any of your toll-free number's messages. This guidance is included at the end of each of your texts.

To resubscribe, a contact can either reply UNSTOP or START to your toll-free number's messages.

They can also sign up on one of your displays again. They may or may not need to complete the Double Opt-In process again.

## FAQ

**Can I send text messages to anyone that gives me their phone number?**

*No, you can only send text messages to contacts that go through the double opt-in process, explicitly giving you their consent to receiving text messages.*

**Can I send text messages to contacts that opted-in to receive emails from me?** 

*No, email consent is separate from SMS consent and must be collected within their respective methods for collection - email consent being collectable via displays through single/double opt-in, and SMS consent only through double opt-in.*

**Am I required to have an opt-in checkbox on my displays to collect SMS consent?**

*No, a checkbox is no longer required for SMS consent. You still have the option to add one if you'd like.*

**Can I import textable phone numbers to my Privy account?** 

*If you have existing textable contacts, you can import them via spreadsheet. They need to have been collected* *in a TCPA-compliant manner. Please note that by submitting a list for upload, you certify that you collected subscribers in a TCPA-compliant manner. If you're not sure, please consult your attorney.*
