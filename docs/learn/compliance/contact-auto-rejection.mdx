Privy automatically rejects specific email addresses during imports to help ensure your list remains as healthy as possible. A high-quality list is crucial for ensuring that your messages reach your desired audience and helps reduce the risk of your message bouncing or getting flagged as spam.

<Icon icon="circle-question" /> **Why do we practice this?** Accounts that send emails with a high rate of negative engagement are placed in a suspension state until Privy's Deliverability Team reviews and clears them for further use.

  **Note:** Automatic contact rejection is just one of the ways Privy helps you maintain list quality. Check out the List Hygiene article for more information and recommendations.

## Types of addresses that are rejected

Privy currently blocks four types of addresses during an import automatically:

<Icon icon="robot" /> **Bot**: A bot address is generated by programs that execute automated, repetitive, pre-defined tasks, commonly imitating human behavior. These addresses usually follow a specific format, include particular prefixes, or utilize certain low-quality or fake domains. Privy evaluates an address for each of these elements and checks it against a database of known bots. Learn more about Privy's approach to handling bots in [this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/84-list-hygiene-remove-bots). 

<Icon icon="share-from-square" /> **Broadcast**: A broadcast address is specifically used to distribute (e.g., Forward) any received messages to multiple individuals within a company or network. Consequently, each recipient cannot consent to receive the messages. This lack of individual consent does not meet Privy's compliance requirements or various laws tied to commercial messaging.  

<Icon icon="briefcase" /> **Role**: A role address (e.g., admin@, support@, sales@, office@, marketing@) acts as a centralized contact point or a shared working space for a non-specific person or group. It differs from a personal account because it is associated with a role and is not tied to or associated with any particular individual. These addresses typically forward messages to groups, invalidating the unsubscribe function and violating Privy's compliance guidelines. The unsubscribe link must be active and relevant for each email address that receives the message.

<Icon icon="receipt" /> **Transactional**: A transactional address (e.g., @marketplace.com) sends automated emails from one sender to one recipient, usually about account activity or a commercial transaction. These addresses are typically system-generated and managed, so Privy does not consider them valid.

If an address falls into one of these four categories, it is suppressed to protect your deliverability rate.
