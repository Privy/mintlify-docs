## What is CCPA?

The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) is a California, USA, law that went into effect in January of 2020. This privacy act gives consumers more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them. The four main tenants of the legislation are: 

* The [right to know](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#sectionc) about the information collected about them and how it is used and shared

* The [right to delete](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#sectione) personal information collected from them (with some exceptions)

* The [right to opt-out](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#sectionb) of the sale of their personal information

* The [right to non-discrimination](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#sectionf) for exercising their CCPA rights

Privy launched new [Terms and Conditions](https://www.privy.com/terms-and-conditions), [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.privy.com/acceptable-use-policy), and [Data Processing Addendum](https://www.privy.com/data-processing-addendum) to reflect the changing legislative landscape. Each resource is consistently reevaluated, including revisions to all documents in 2022, to ensure that Privy follows best practices and evolving legal legislation concerning CCPA. Please review these documents to ensure your business remains compliant while using Privy services.
