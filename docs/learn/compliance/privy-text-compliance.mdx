Privy strives to provide quality services that empower our merchants to comply with legal standards and create highly engaging messaging.  Privy takes compliance and subscriber messaging seriously — and you should, too.

We've put together this guide to make it easy for you to ensure your SMS/MMS marketing campaigns comply with U.S. laws and regulations, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).



## What is TCPA?

The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) establishes mandatory requirements for businesses using SMS and MMS messaging for marketing communications. The fundamental requirement is clear: **businesses must obtain explicit written consent before sending automated marketing messages to consumers. This consent must clearly disclose the marketing nature of future communications, specify message types and frequency, and acknowledge that consent is not a condition of purchase.**

TCPA compliance requires maintaining comprehensive records of consumer consent, including when and how consent was obtained, along with proper documentation of opt-out requests. Businesses must implement clear opt-out mechanisms and immediately honor all consumer requests to discontinue communications. **Violations can result in significant penalties, including fines of $500-$1,500 per violation and potential class action litigation.**

For additional guidance, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) provides supplementary guidelines covering message frequency, content standards, and technical requirements. Organizations should consult legal counsel to ensure their SMS marketing programs fully comply with current TCPA regulations and industry standards.

In addition, several states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, Tennessee and Washington have passed 'Mini-TCPA' laws that are often more strict than the federal TCPA law.

It is your responsibility to ensure that when using Privy to send messages to consumers, you understand and are complying with all relevant TCPA regulations and compliance with laws imposed by other jurisdictions.
