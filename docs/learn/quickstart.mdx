If you have existing customer contacts, [import them into Privy via spreadsheet](https://help.privy.com/docs/learn/contact-management/import-and-manage-contacts) to start engaging with your audience right away.

## 3. Register for SMS

If you're on our Growth Plan and planning on using Privy Text, your business needs to submit a registration form to be approved for a toll-free number. **You must register and be approved for your toll-free number before you can start collecting textable contacts and/or sending text messages.**

## 4. Set up your domain records

To ensure the best deliverability possible + brand recognition with your audience, set up your custom sending domain in Privy.

Our team also recommends making sure that you have the proper DMARC, SPF, and DKIM authentication records in place so that you're meeting Google and Yahoo's sender requirements.

## 6. Activate an automation

Automations are emails and texts that are triggered by meaningful actions taken by your contacts, such as abandoning a cart or placing an order. These emails and texts are integral to your marketing strategy because they allow you to send personalized content to your audience without ever lifting a finger.

To get started, head to **Automations** and click "New automation" in the upper righthand corner. Choose which kind you want to create, and start customizing your templates and settings!

To send your first email, head to **Campaigns** and click "New email" in the upper righthand corner. Choose from one of our basic or stylized templates, customize your content with our drag-and-drop editor.
