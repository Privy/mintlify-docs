The default address used to send emails from your account is a shared Privy
address. However, to [improve your email
deliverability](https://www.privy.com/blog/how-to-improve-email-
deliverability) and build trust with your email recipients, this address
should be updated to reflect your specific domain and brand.

Check out the resource below if you've attempted to make this change but have
encountered verification issues.

# Invalid records

Typically, we'd suggest that you copy and paste the host values provided in
[your account](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/sending-domains):

    
    
    scph1218._domainkey
    s1._domainkey
    s2._domainkey
    privy-sg
    privy._verification
    

However, some providers will not verify when your brand and top-level domains
are excluded from these host values. For example, if you enter privy-sg in the
Host Name, the provider will throw an error because it expects privy-
sg.yourdomain.com instead.

Add your domain information to each host value and input those values instead
to troubleshoot this issue. After adding your domain to the records, they will
look something like the following:

    
    
    scph1218._domainkey.yourdomain.com
    s1._domainkey.yourdomain.com
    s2._domainkey.yourdomain.com
    privy-sg.yourdomain.com
    privy._verification.yourdomain.com
    

**Note:** You will still be able to send emails from your domain if the TXT
record for scph1218._domainkey is not verified. In some cases, your domain
will use the hosting provider's DKIM instead.
