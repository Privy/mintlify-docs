Your Automations are all set up; now you want to take them to the next level.
Advanced Automations allow you even more control of your audience, which
allows for more tailored communication and content.

### What settings can I control to advance my Automations?

  * Edit your Automation message based on Cart Value:
  * Edit your Automation based on Products or Collections:
  * Edit your Automation based on Timing:
  * Edit your automation by adding additional emails to your series:

Anytime you are building an Advanced Automation strategy, the idea is that you
are drilling more into purchase behavior based on what you know about a
shopper.

As an example, you probably have a good understanding of your storeâ€™s Average
Order Value. If you know that you are communicating with a shopper who has a
Cart Value that is higher than your AOV, you could offer them a different
incentive or further personalize the content in the emails you send them.

  * Maybe the shopper has a specific item in their cart that requires additional instruction to use or has a unique property to it that warrants additional content as the consumer makes their purchasing decision.

Just like you can use this information to help incentivize shoppers to
complete a purchase, you can use the same type of information to communicate
with them post-purchase.

  * It is much easier to create a repeat purchaser than to require a new purchaser

In your Purchase Follow-Up emails, you can use the same email
settings/triggers to tailor your communication to the purchaser.

  * Did they complete a large purchase?
  * Does the product they purchased require instructions?
  * Did they purchase around a Holiday?

These details should be taken into strategic consideration when building out
Advanced Automation Flows. Following up and saying Thank You is always
recommended - then create additional messaging in the form of another follow-
up email:

The key to Advanced Automation is to identify the moments when you know extra
details about your customers. Once you know more about them, use that
information to better inform your own content, thus focusing your Automation
strategy.
