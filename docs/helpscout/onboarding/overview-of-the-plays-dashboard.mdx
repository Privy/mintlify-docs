The new Privy template dashboard lets you quickly select, customize, and
launch displays. The pre-built
[templates](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/181-should-i-use-a-play-
or-build-my-own-display) represent the top-performing displays across Privy's
customer base, and all the best practices have already been baked in.
