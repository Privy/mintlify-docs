Segmenting campaigns is the new norm; we’re hearing it all over the place, and
it’s hard to avoid. If it's one of those things you’ve been putting off, today
is the day to change that. What is segmenting, and why do you need it?

### Segmenting emails is the division of contacts into smaller groups
(segments) and sending the emails out based on the criteria you choose.

Not only will segmenting your emails and choosing the correct contacts to send
out your marketing return more revenue per recipient, it will also maintain
deliverability and ensure you are communicating to your customers in the
correct way. Send your personalized emails to customers who can relate to
them.

Segmenting your emails will also increase your open rates, increase your
click-through rates, decrease your subscribers, and, most importantly, avoid
spam filters based on flags from email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook,
and others!

Privy makes it very easy to target your audience using Smart Segments. Start
by sending emails to current customers, engaged or unengaged customers, and
potential customers with the pre-built segments. It will make sending the
right message to the right contact at the right time easier on you and
resonate better with the contact you are engaging.

Privy takes the hard work out of segmenting for you; if you have contacts in
your dashboard, you already have segments pre-built right in your dashboard.

A few other examples of how you might use segments to reach your target
audience include:

  * Send a special promotion to customers who currently have any amount in their shopping cart and have never made a purchase.
  * Attempt to re-engage inactive subscribers who signed up at least six months ago but haven't been seen recently or haven't opened your last few emails.
  * Send a thank you or special reward to VIP customers who have purchased at least X times before or have spent over X amount of money.
  * Send a special offer to contacts who have purchased a specific product or an item from a particular collection (Shopify only). 

Segments can be larger groups of people (think those who have purchased from
you in the past) or smaller bunches of segments to target a more direct
audience (think customers who have spent a minimum of $100 + made 2 or more
purchases with your store.)

Email segmentation can be used in a variety of ways and evolve into a
technique you will use on a regular basis; sending your emails and marketing
to the right customers at the right time will drive sales and make your
business a better brand overall - in the new age of email that were in,
utilizing these strategies can make the difference between emails opened and
revenue-driving or emails ending up at the bottom of the inbox or the
unmentionable spam folder.
