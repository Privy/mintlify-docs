An order is counted when someone signs up for your Privy display and then
completes a purchase through your store using the same email address. Privy
counts an order regardless of whether or not the customer used a discount
code. This method of order attribution is used because many Privy merchants
indicated that offering a discount was often incentive enough for customers to
buy, even when those same customers might not apply the code at the time of
purchase.

**Note:** Once a visitor signs up for a display, they will be considered an
"order" for that display if they make a purchase following the signup. If the
visitor signs up for multiple displays and then makes a purchase, the order
metric will increase for all submitted displays. Following a purchase, the
attribution cycle resets.

# Track your orders

With your [e-commerce store
connected](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-your-
site), Privy will automatically look for contacts who registered via Privy
displays and track whether or not they completed a purchase. If they do, Privy
will add an "order" event to the contact's profile and increase the overall
order count associated with the display and your account.

## Dashboard-level Tracking

Orders listed on the Dashboard are counted when a customer completes a
purchase after opening a message.

Note: Orders counted on the Dashboard may also be counted on the Display page.

## Contact-level Tracking

Order events attributed to a customer will appear in their **Activity Feed**
and increase the **Total Orders** metric listed at the top of their profile.
To access this information, navigate to the
[Contacts](https://dashboard.privy.com/contacts) dashboard and click the name
or email address of the contact that you'd like to review.

## Display-level Tracking

Orders attributed to a particular display will appear when a report is run on
it. Additional information on using the Reports tool is available
[here](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/25-overview-of-privy-reports).

**Note:** Orders counted on the Displays page may also be counted in other
areas. For example, a customer who has never placed a purchase signs up
through a form on your site but does not complete a purchase until after
receiving a Welcome email. Their order would count as an order for both the
Welcome email and the Display.
