The Build Your Own designer allows you to create the visual components of the
displays that your customers will see when visiting your store, such as pop-
ups, flyouts, and banners. This option offers expanded customization
opportunities through a drag-and-drop interface. It is only recommended for
users who understand what makes a display successful, as every setting and
design decision is configured manually. For a more streamlined experience and
a simpler process for creating your displays, use one of the pre-built
examples available on the [Plays
Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.com/plays).

Though a little longer than usual, this tutorial will walk you through the
entire design process and should help you understand your capabilities to
design your displays within Privy.

# Access the designer

  * On your Privy Dashboard, go to **Convert >All Displays.**
  * Select an existing Classic Display or click **New Display**.
  * On the resulting page, locate and click on the section "Prefer the classic creation experience? 

 _Click here_ to get started."

  * Name your display and then click on **Create Display**.
  * On the resulting page, click on the **Add display** option.
  * From there, you will be able to choose a variety of templates that are completely editable. Once you choose the desired template, click on **Choose Selected**.
  * You will then be taken to the Classic Editor to edit the display.
  * Once you apply the needed changes to the design, click on the Save button and, if needed, edit the target and follow up steps before publishing your display.
