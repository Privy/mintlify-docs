Warming up a sending domain is essential for ensuring high deliverability
rates and maintaining a good sender reputation. This guide will walk you
through the best practices for warming up a brand new domain and when
switching between email service providers (ESPs).

# Introduction to Domain Warming

Warming up a sending domain involves gradually increasing the volume of emails
sent from a new domain to build a positive sender reputation with Internet
Service Providers (ISPs). This is crucial when starting with a new domain or
changing ESPs to avoid being flagged as spam.

## Preparing Your Domain

  * **Brand New Domain:**
    * Set up DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records.
    * Authenticate your domain with your ESP by setting up 
    * Ensure your domain is clean and hasn’t been previously blacklisted.
  * **Switching ESPs:**
    * Verify DKIM, SPF, and DMARC records are updated to reflect the new ESP.
    * Re-import and map all contact permissions accurately to the new system.

## Warming Up Process

  * **Week 1:**
    * Send emails to your most engaged users (open rates > 30%).
    * Limit volume to 50-100 emails per day.
  * **Week 2:**
    * Gradually increase the volume by 100% daily, targeting engaged users.
    * Monitor bounce rates and engagement closely.
  * **Week 3 and Beyond:**
    * Continue to double the daily sending volume each week.
    * Begin including less engaged users in small batches.
    * Adjust the pace based on ISP feedback and engagement metrics.

## Best Practices

  * **Monitor Performance:**
    * Use tools to track open rates, click-through rates, and bounces.
    * Watch for any signs of being flagged as spam and adjust accordingly.
    * Use the available Postmaster tools (i.e., Google and Yahoo) to monitor your domain’s health
  * **Engage with Contacts:**
    * Send personalized and relevant content.
    * Promptly handle unsubscribe requests to maintain a clean list.
  * **Maintain List Hygiene:**
    * Regularly update and clean your email list.
    * Remove inactive contacts to improve engagement metrics.
  * **Compliance:**
    * Ensure all contacts have explicitly opted-in to receive emails.
    * Adhere to CAN-SPAM Act regulations and other relevant laws.

# Troubleshooting

  * **High Bounce Rates:**
    * Review and improve email content and relevance.
    * Verify email addresses and use double opt-in methods.
  * **Low Engagement:**
    * Segment your audience for targeted campaigns.
    * Improve subject lines and email content to boost interest.

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively warm up your
sending domain, ensuring high deliverability and a strong sender reputation.
