Since February 2024, major email service providers like Google and Yahoo have
implemented changes to sending requirements. These changes have caused
widespread issues.

We’ve put together this article to help you ensure you’re up to date with all
the requirements and best practices, ensuring your deliverability is as good
as possible.

## Email authentication records

First, please ensure your DMARC/DKIM/SPF records are all in place. This
requirement **cannot** be overlooked.

This process is done directly with your domain service provider and can vary
from provider to provider.

We have an article that details this process, which you can access
[here](https://help.privy.com/article/10-dmarc-dkim-spf-record-
authentication).

## Email providers requirements

Alongside the requirements for authentication records, each email provider has
its own other requirements that all bulk senders should follow.

These requirements range from email content to domain settings and can be
found in full on the following links:

  * [Google Sender Guidelines](https://support.google.com/a/answer/81126?hl=en)
  * [Yahoo Sender Best Practices](https://senders.yahooinc.com/best-practices/)
  * [Outlook Policies, Practices, and Guidelines](https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/policies.aspx)

## Warming up your domain

For new domains or domains that recently added authentication records
(DMARC/DKIM/SPF), it’s important to warm up your domain so that major inbox
providers such as Google and Yahoo can detect the progression of your domain’s
reputation.

This is an essential step to ensure a good sending reputation, but please bear
in mind that this can be a lengthy process, taking weeks or months to warm up
a domain properly.

We have more details on how you can do that in this article ->[ How to Warm Up
a Sending Domain](https://help.privy.com/article/556-how-to-warm-up-a-sending-
domain)

## Postmaster tools

Big email providers also have tools called postmaster tools that allow you to
investigate how your domain performs on their platform.

These are great if you want more insight into your domain’s sending reputation
and SPAM rates.

You can find these postmaster tools for the biggest email providers here:

  * [Gmail Postmaster Tools](https://gmail.com/postmaster/)
  * [Outlook Postmaster Tools](https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/)
  * [Yahoo Postmaster Tools](https://senders.yahooinc.com/)

Take advantage of these tools to monitor your domain’s health!

## Summary of best practices

And finally, here’s a summary of best practices you can use to improve your
deliverability and sending reputation:

  * Use a[ custom sending domain](https://help.privy.com/article/33-use-a-custom-sending-domain) to identify the source of the email more clearly.
  * Ensure your sending domain is[ warmed up](https://help.privy.com/article/556-how-to-warm-up-a-sending-domain) before sending emails to all contacts.
  * Have all three[ authentication records](https://help.privy.com/article/10-dmarc-dkim-spf-record-authentication) in place with your domain provider.
  * Keep your subject line concise and avoid all caps. Shoot for between 28 to 50 characters.
  * Keep your preheader concise. Shoot for between 40 to 100 characters.
  * Keep your email concise. Shoot for between 50 and 125 words.
  * Personalize your emails with merge tags. For example, include the subscriber's name.
  * Avoid spammy keywords like guarantee, opportunity, click, and winner.
  * Avoid using special characters like %, $, &, !, ?, @, and # excessively.
  * Avoid excessive use of images. Emails that use too many images or are all one image can trigger a spam filter. Using several lines of text to separate images helps avoid this.
  * Avoid using too many links or calls to action.

Periodically check into the postmaster tools of major inbox providers such as
Google and Yahoo.
