The Reports tool makes it easy to review how your displays and associated
after-signup emails perform. By using this tool, you can leverage your data to
uncover trends in customer preferences and align your team around a strategy
that capitalizes on those trends to grow your business.

# Access the reports dashboard

# Available information

The reports dashboard allows you to generate a report based on four filters:

  1. **Choose your metric**. You can view your results based on your signup rate, number of views, clicks, signups, emails sent, orders, order rate, or link clicks. Please note that order tracking is only available for stores using Shopify, ShopifyPlus, Weebly, or Magento2.
  2. **Decide how you want to break out the data**. The options for each metric are different. For example, when reporting on Signups, you can organize the data by Events(e.g., Each signup submission), Display, Display trigger (e.g., exit intent, timer, scroll), Display type (e.g., flyout, popup, banner), UTM source (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter, Paid search), UTM display, or Claim location if youâ€™re using offline redemptions. 
  3. **Select the desired dataset**. You can view the results of a single display or all displays.
  4. **Set a date range**. See how your content is performing for the last week or over an extended period of time using the date picker.
