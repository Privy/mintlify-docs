To sync the contacts captured by your Privy Convert displays to your Klaviyo
account, you must link (integrate) the two accounts and add automation rules
to your displays.

# Link the accounts

To link your Privy account with your Klaviyo account:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the**Integrations** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * Scroll down to the _Available Integrations_ section and select the **Klaviyo** option. 
  * Create a **new API Key** in your Klaviyo account
  * Enter your credentials and [API Key](https://www.klaviyo.com/account#api-keys-tab) in the prompt and then select **Link Account**. 

Note: When creating the Public API Key we recommend selecting the option
"Grant applications full access for every API scope.

All set! Klaviyo should now appear as a linked account in the _Authorized
Accounts_ section. Next, let's add some automation rules.

# Add an automation rule

**Note:** These settings must be set for each display individually.

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to
Klaviyo:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays**.
  * Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. The selected display must include a form to sync contacts. 
  * Click the **Advanced Settings** button at the bottom left of the page, Scroll to the **Sync Integration** section, select**Klaviyo** from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**. 

**Note:** Privy contacts can only sync to Klaviyo lists, not to [Klaviyo
segments](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005061447-The-
Difference-Between-Segments-and-Lists). Please be aware that this integration
is not a two-way sync, meaning that information can sync from Privy to Klaviyo
but cannot sync back from Klaviyo to Privy.

**Warning:** To successfully sync contacts with a phone number to Klaviyo, the
number must be formatted using the [E.164
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) on the contact's profile in
Privy. When collecting US-based or Canada-based numbers, the +1 country code
is not required, as Privy will validate the number and automatically add this
information if it is missing. All other numbers must include the country code
(e.g., +44 for the UK). Privy will add the plus sign (+) if it is omitted.

This display's signups will now sync to Klaviyo. Click on the **Sync signups**
button again to sync contacts to additional services or lists. Check out [this
guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/108-use-display-automation-
rules) for more information on automation rules and how to troubleshoot common
sync issues.

# Is more information available?

Yes. You can also tag a visitor with a [Klaviyo session
cookie](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034666712-About-Cookies-
in-Klaviyo#klaviyo-tracking-cookies1) after capturing an email with a Privy
Convert display. This cookie allows you to trigger cart abandonment and browse
abandonment emails directly from Klaviyo. To enable this feature:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * Select **Customizations** from the sidebar and scroll down to the _Other Customizations_ section. 
  * Check the**Enable Klaviyo Javascript integration** setting and then click **Save Changes**.
