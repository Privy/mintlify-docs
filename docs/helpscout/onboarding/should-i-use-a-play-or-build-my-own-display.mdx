Privy offers two distinct display creation experiences depending on your
decision to use a ready-to-go play or build a more customized display from
scratch. Check out the key differences between the experiences below.

# Templates- Speed and Simplicity

The New[ Display Builder](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/97-overview-
of-the-plays-dashboard) is a more streamlined experience, offering a quicker
and simpler process for creating displays. Use it if you want to get a high-
performing display ready right away, without the need to dig deep into display
settings and design decisions. Each play is fully responsive by default and
incorporates Privy's best practices and top-performing layouts.

To get started with this experience, select **Convert** > **All Displays > New
Display** option from the main navigation bar and then choose the play that
best aligns with your goals.

# The Classic Builder

The Build Your Own editor offers expanded customization options via a drag-
and-drop interface when creating your display. This option is only recommended
for users with a good understanding of what makes a display successful, as
every setting and design decision is configured manually.

To get started with this experience, from the main navigation bar, select
**Convert** >**All Displays,** click the **New display** option, and then
select the **Get Start** button under _Prefer the classic creation
experience?_ at the bottom-left.
