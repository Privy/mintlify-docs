Once you've created an email, you will find it on the corresponding Abandoned
Cart, Customer Winback, Newsletter, or Purchase Follow-up dashboard. Editing
an email from these dashboards, including those you've already started working
on or activated, only takes a few simple steps.

**Note:** Changes to "Active" automated emails - all emails other than
newsletters - go into effect immediately. Future recipients will receive
emails that include the changes you've made.

# Edit a sent newsletter

  * Navigate to **Campaigns**. 
  * Locate the newsletter you want to edit, click the 3-dot menu, and select**Duplicate Campaign**.

  * Confirm your decision by selecting **Duplicate** in the prompt. 
  * Rename the new draft so it's easy to identify as a new version. 
  * Make your changes and **Save**. 

**Note:** It is not possible to edit an email that has already been sent. You
will need to duplicate the email and resend it with corrections.
