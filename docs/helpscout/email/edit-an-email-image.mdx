With the Privy Image Editor, you can crop, resize, and add effects to an image
to better fit your email content. The image editor is available for images
from the stock image library and those uploaded from your computer. Check out
[this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/80-guidelines-for-
creative-assets) for more information on using creative assets in your
content.

# Access the image editor

To access the image editor:

  * In the email editor, select an image.

# Apply filter or effects to an image

To apply a filter or effect (e.g., stickers, frames, text) to your image,
select the appropriate option and configure its settings. Click the **Apply**
button once you're finished with each option, and click the **Save** button in
the editor's toolbar to lock in your changes.

# Resize, crop, or transform an image

To resize your image:

  * Click **Resize**.
  * Enter the width and height for your image in pixels or enable the percentage checkbox to use percentages instead. Maintaining the aspect ratios is recommended to ensure the image's original width-to-height relationship is maintained. 
  * Click the **Apply** button. If this is the only change you want to make, click the **Save** button in the editor's toolbar to lock in your changes. 

To crop your image:

  * Click **Crop**.
  * Enter the width and height for your image in pixels or select a predefined aspect ratio. 
  * Click the **Apply** button. If this is the only change you want to make, click the **Save** button in the editor's toolbar to lock in your changes. 

# Troubleshoot common issues

## Image quality and sizing

Privy's email templates are 600px wide by default and support specific image
file types to ensure a consistent and high-quality experience for your
recipients. Learn more about the recommended asset file types and sizes here:
[Guidelines for creative
assets](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/80-guidelines-for-creative-
assets).

## Unwanted image stacking on mobile

Privy's email templates stack the contents of columns, such as an image and
its accompanying text, to make reviewing the content easier to read on mobile
devices. If you'd like to disable this default behavior and prevent elements
from stacking when displayed on mobile devices:

  * In the email editor, select the row that contains the image. 
  * On the left side, select the **Mobile** tab. 
  * Scroll down and activate the **Do not stack on mobile** option. 
  * On the top right corner, click the **Save** button.
