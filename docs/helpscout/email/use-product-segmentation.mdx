In Privy, purchase follow-up and abandoned cart messages can be sent to
customers based on their order history or what they've left in their cart.
This product-based segmentation allows you to send relevant product messaging
and personalized recommendations to customers, which are both powerful
strategies for driving sales, improving conversion rates, and increasing order
value.

**Note:** This functionality is only available for accounts integrated
with**Shopify**. Additionally, **segmentation is optional**. Without these
settings enabled, you can still send abandoned cart messages and purchase
follow-up messages.

# Purchase follow-up messages

There's a fantastic opportunity to build a stronger relationship and encourage
repeat business with your customers following a purchase. Instead of sending
traditional marketing materials, consider sending complimentary resources that
empower the customer to use your product successfully. Suppose you sell food
products, and a customer has just purchased some ginger broth. You now have an
opportunity to send them a recipe or an FAQ, which will help them to use your
product and encourage them to return when they need similar products in the
future.

To enable product segmentation for a purchase follow-up email:

  * In your Privy account, click the **Automations** option in the main navigation.
  * You can edit an existing email draft by clicking the New Automation button and selecting the Purchase Follow-Up option from the popup, or you can create a new email by clicking the New Automation button.
  * In the **Settings** step of the email builder, click **Edit** next to the "_Trigger settings "_ header.
  * Locate the _Product ID_ field and select the desired filter and product(s) from the dropdown menus. If you are encountering issues locating an item via the product dropdown, check out the troubleshooting steps.
  * Select the **Save Changes** option at the top right.

  * Select the **Activate** option at the top right to start sending the email to eligible recipients.

# Abandoned cart messages

Sometimes a simple reminder isn't enough to get an interested individual to
complete a purchase. If this reminds you of your customers, ask yourself what
motivates them to select your product or engage with your brand. Maybe you
sell sustainably sourced footwear, and someone has just left a pair of your
newest sneakers in their cart. You now have an opportunity not only to remind
the prospect of the item they've left behind but also the impact of their
decision to purchase a sustainable product, the quality of your materials, or
perhaps the story of the product's development.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues locating a product using the Product ID dropdown,
please attempt the steps outlined below. This more manual method allows you to
hone in on a specific item quickly and is particularly useful for merchants
with large catalogs.

  * After locating the  _Product ID_ field in the Triggers section of the email or text builder, open a separate tab and navigate to your Shopify dashboard. 
  * Select the **Products** option from the lefthand sidebar. 
  * Locate a product you'd like to use for segmentation and click on it to view its information. 
  * In the browser bar, copy the ID number at the end of the URL. 
  * Navigate back to Privy and paste the ID number into the _Product ID_ field. Repeat this process for each product you'd like to use for segmentation. 
  * Select the **Save Changes** option at the bottom right of the _Trigger Settings_ section.
