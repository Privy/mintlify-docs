If you have subscribers who didn't open a
[newsletter](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/169-send-newsletter-
emails) that they might find particularly relevant or useful, you may want to
send it again. Resending a newsletter can cause unsubscribes, but if you only
do it once and within a day or two of the first send time, it may help you
boost your overall engagement.

# Recommendations

To reduce the risk of a re-sent newsletter resulting in unsubscribes or spam
complaints, please consider keeping your subject line and visible "From" name
the same. Changing this information while maintaining the same content can
come across as deceptive or intentionally tricky. Meanwhile, most subscribers
are happy to keep engaging if you lead with honesty and are straightforward
about who you are and why you're sending the email. That's why they signed up,
after all.

# Resend your newsletter

To resend a newsletter:

  * Navigate to **Campaigns** and locate the newsletter that you'd like to resend.
  * Select the three dot menu and select**Duplicate Campaign**
  * Be sure to rename the copy so that you can easily differentiate between emails

  * Select **Custom segment** and then select **New Segment**. 
  * Name your segment on the resulting page.
  * Use the dropdown labeled _Choose Category_ and select **Did not open.**
  * Then select the original newsletter from the subsequent prompt, click the **Create** button, and then click **Save**.

  * Now select either the **Send** or the **Schedule** button at the top of the _Settings_ page. Selecting the _Send_ button will prompt the email to go out immediately and ignore any settings configured in the _Schedule_ section of the email's _Sender Info_.
  * Confirm your decision to activate in the subsequent prompt.
