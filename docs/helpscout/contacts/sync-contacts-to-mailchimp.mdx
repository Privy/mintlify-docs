To sync the contacts captured by your Privy Convert displays to your Mailchimp
account, you must link (integrate) the two accounts and add automation rules
to your displays.

# Link the accounts

To link your Privy account with your Mailchimp account:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the**Integrations** option from the dropdown menu.
  * Scroll down to the _Available Integrations_ section.
  * Select the **Mailchimp** option, enter your credentials in the prompt, and select **Login**. 
  * Follow the prompts to allow the proper permissions and select your account.

All set! Mailchimp should now appear as a linked account in the _Authorized
Accounts_ section. Next, add some automation rules.

# Add an automation rule

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to
Mailchimp:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays**. 
  * Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Follow-up** step of the display builder. The selected display must include a form to sync contacts. 
  * Click the **Sync signups** button, select Mailchimp from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**. If you enable the **Require Double Opt-in** setting, please note that the synced contacts will receive a confirmation email. They must click the verification link in that email before they are added to your mailable Mailchimp audience. [Learn more](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-double-opt-in/).

This display's signups will now sync to Mailchimp. Click on the **Sync
signups** button again to sync contacts to additional services or lists. Check
out [this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/108-use-display-
automation-rules) for more information on automation rules and how to
troubleshoot common sync issues. A section on troubleshooting Mailchimp-
specific issues is available below.

**Note:** These settings must be set for each display individually.

# Troubleshoot issues

Here are a few issues you may encounter when setting up or using the Mailchimp
integration.

### **Expired or disconnected error**

The integration's connection may expire or disconnect for a wide range of
reasons. To ensure that Privy and the external service are still properly
integrated:

  * Navigate to **Account Settings** > **Integrations**. 
  * Locate the **Linked Accounts** section. 
  * Select the **Test Account** option.

This will trigger a reading (e.g., Connection Successful) that will help guide
your next steps.

### **Permissions error**

You can only connect a Mailchimp account to Privy if you are the account's
Owner or Admin. To review these requirements and make any necessary changes,
please review [this resource](https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-
in-your-account/) from Mailchimp. Once an Owner or Admin is available, they
can attempt to link the accounts again.

### **Sync errors**

If you see an error when exporting or syncing to an audience (list) in
Mailchimp like:

  * FNAME must be provided – Please enter a value
  * MMERGE10 must be provided – Please enter a value

It means that you are syncing Privy contacts to an audience (list) in
Mailchimp that has required fields that aren't being provided during the Privy
signup. To fix this, follow these steps:

  * Navigate to your **Audience** dashboard in Mailchimp.
  * Select the audience (list) you have chosen to export or sync to in Privy.
  * Click the **Manage Audience** dropdown menu and then click **Settings**.

  * Locate and select the **Audience fields and *|MERGE|* tags** option. 
  * On the next page, you'll see the fields associated with this audience (list), as well as a checkbox next to any field that is REQUIRED. Uncheck all required fields except the email field.

That's it! Future signups won't be rejected for not having these fields.
