The simplicity and pervasiveness of text messaging has made SMS marketing an
emerging top sales channel for businesses. The resources below will help you
implement best practices as you develop your own SMS marketing strategy.

# Get consent before sending

For SMS marketing, you must always get permission before texting your
contacts. You always want to make sure your contacts have agreed to get
marketing text messages from your brand. Agreeing to receive email marketing
or simply submitting a phone number isn‚Äôt enough. Privy does not currently
accept imported phone numbers as textable contacts. Instead, a contact's phone
number must be collected through a Privy form with the phone field and the
Text Opt-in Disclaimer, and the contact must have answered "YES" to the
[double opt-in](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/135-understand-double-
opt-in-doi) message sent to their number to receive texts from Privy. This
series of actions provides [explicit
consent](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/206-understand-marketing-
consent) and ensures [SMS
compliance](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/149-privy-email-and-sms-
compliance).

# Keep texts short

Lengthy text messages can feel overwhelming, even when they‚Äôre from a family
member or friend.

If you‚Äôre using SMS as a marketing channel, it‚Äôs even more important to keep
text messages short and concise. The goal of a marketing text message is to
capture attention and inspire action as quickly as possible. If your text
message takes more than a few seconds to read, it‚Äôs too long.

## Understanding SMS character counts

We recommend trying to stay under 200 characters for a marketing text message.
This includes spaces and line breaks, your business name, personalization
variables, links, and opt-out language.

Including personalization variables, like your contact‚Äôs First Name, in your
text messages is a great way to help your message stand out. Keep in mind that
the character count for dynamic content like this can vary from contact to
contact, so it‚Äôs best to keep your accompanying message brief to stay within
the recommended character count.

As you draft your text message in Privy, the character count will
automatically update to help you gauge how long your message is. If you happen
to add more than 200 characters to your message, please note that your text
message must be under 400 characters to send with Privy.

If you exceed 200 characters in your text, the message itself will look like
one message from the recipient‚Äôs standpoint, but your engagement rates may be
negatively impacted. Concise messages tend to perform better in terms of click
rates and revenue generation.

## Copywriting best practices

Texting is simple (you can‚Äôt highlight, bold, or underline words), so you have
limited space to make your message stand out. Here are our top tips to
optimize your copywriting:

  * Give special attention to the first few words of your message that your recipients will see as the preview in their text inbox. Treat these words like you would an email subject line, make a strong first impression to increase the likelihood of your message being opened. 
  * Use powerful words and short phrases to inspire action quickly and show a sense of urgency. Some phrases to consider:
    * Limited-time offer
    * While supplies last
    * Get it before it‚Äôs gone
    * Limited quantity
    * Sales ends September 12
    * Don‚Äôt miss out
  * Avoid using text-speak wherever you can (unless it‚Äôs part of your brand voice). Abbreviations may help save characters, but over-using these can come across as spammy to your recipients. Acronyms and shorthand (e.g. ‚Äúlmk‚Äù or ‚ÄúTY‚Äù) may not be recognizable to all of your recipients.

**Don 't do this:**

üëéDnt 4get to 2 use code BFCM20 before 12pm tmrw 4 free shipping!

**Do this:**

Don‚Äôt forget to use code BFCM20 before 12pm tomorrow for free shipping!

  * Choose emojis wisely. Special characters like emojis can add a bit of flare to a text message, but we recommend using them sparingly to avoid coming across as spammy. Don‚Äôt use multiple emojis or emojis that feel off-brand just for the sake of including one. If an emoji doesn‚Äôt fit into your campaign, don‚Äôt force it.

**Don 't do this:**

"üî•üî•üî•‚ÄãSALE!!!"

**Do this:**

"Check out our sale!"

  * End with a strong call-to-action (CTA). Use your CTA to tell recipients exactly what next step to take. For example, ‚ÄúClick to shop now.‚Äù

# Include a short URL

A benefit to SMS as a marketing channel is that it is immediate and direct,
which means that click rates are often higher than email.

It‚Äôs always a good idea to include a link in your text messages. Links make it
easier for your subscribers to head to your site and give you a critical piece
of information to evaluate your campaign performance. Without a link, you
won‚Äôt know which messages resonate best with your subscribers or identify
opportunities to improve future campaigns.

When sending a [broadcast text
](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/179-send-a-broadcast-text)with
Privy, you should always use the [URL shortening tool
](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/179-send-a-broadcast-text)to
generate a link that will track your clicks and revenue attribution.

Do not paste a long link into the body of your message draft. Unfortunately,
long links can come across as spammy and may look less legitimate in the eyes
of recipients. A shortened URL that‚Äôs on brand signals that a text message is
coming from a credible source and can be trusted. Additionally, do not use a
third-party link shortener as this will not be able to track any revenue
generated by your text.

# Stay compliant

There are laws regulating what businesses can and cannot do with SMS, which
may feel overwhelming at first. The good news is that Privy Text is built to
automatically account for many of these rules to help ensure that your
business stays compliant.

As mentioned above, getting consent is a foundational rule of SMS compliance.
Once you have your contacts‚Äô explicit consent to send them text messages,
there are a few other rules to keep in mind.

## Include your business name

Brands are required to include their business name in their text messages so
that recipients know who the message is coming from. Because of this, Privy
will automatically add your business name at the start of every text message.
By default in Privy, your business name is counted in the total amount of
characters within your text message.

## Make it easy to opt out

Another SMS best practice and compliance rule is allowing recipients to
unsubscribe at any time. You risk damaging your brand‚Äôs reputation and
potential fines by continuing to send text messages to someone who no longer
wants to hear from you.

To avoid this, Privy includes brief opt-out instructions that read ‚ÄúSTOP to
opt out‚Äù in every text message. This opt-out language also counts towards the
total amount of characters in your text message.

## Don‚Äôt include prohibited content

Certain materials and content are prohibited from being sent via SMS. If you
are using Privy Text, please ensure you follow our Acceptable Use Policy, as
this is agreed upon in our Terms and Conditions when you first sign up for an
account with Privy.

## Respect quiet hours

When you‚Äôre planning to send a text message, it‚Äôs important to consider the
experience of the recipient. For example, receiving a text message about a
sale at 11 p.m. when someone is in bed likely isn‚Äôt going to inspire them to
shop and may give them a negative impression of your brand.

By default, Privy enforces quiet hours between 8 p.m. and 9 a.m. in a
recipient‚Äôs time zone. This means that no broadcast text messages or abandoned
cart texts will be sent during that time, and will be queued to send after 9
a.m.
