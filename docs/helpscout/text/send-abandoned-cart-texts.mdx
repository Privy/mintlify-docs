With Privy Text, you can send abandoned cart messages to contacts who: visit
your site, add an item to their cart, and then leave without completing the
purchase. Sending these messages encourages your contacts to complete their
purchase and is one of the most impactful things you can do to recover revenue
for your business.

## Things to know

Before attempting to create and send abandoned cart texts, please review the
following:

  * You must subscribe to [Privy Text](https://www.privy.com/text). 
  * You must integrate with Shopify, Shopify Plus, BigCommerce, Weebly, or Wix.
  * A contact's phone number must be collected through a Privy form with the phone field, the contact must have checked the text opt-in checkbox, and the contact must have confirmed their desire to receive messages via double opt-in to receive texts from Privy. 
  * To ensure shoppers do not receive multiple messages, you should disable abandoned checkout or abandoned cart text messages from other providers. 

# Create a text

To create an abandoned cart text:

  * On the main navigation bar, select **Automations** and click the **New Automation** button.
  * Select the **Abandoned Cart** **Text** option from the popup.
  * On the subsequent screen, update the text's default name with the **Edit**() button.

## Message content

  * Customize your text by adding to or completely replacing the default placeholder content. Use the **Personalize** dropdown menu to populate the message with known attributes, coupon codes, and links to relevant content. If you are using Shopify or Shopify Plus, you can also use the **Cart URL** variable to automatically link the contact back to their cart. Check out the example below: 

    
    
    Hey {{ contact.first_name }}! We noticed you left something behind. We're holding onto your cart for now, but hurry, items sell out quickly! {{ cart.url }}
    

  * Once you finish customizing your text message, click **Save Changes**.

## Trigger settings

Next, scroll down, locate the _Trigger Settings_ section, and review the
following:

  1. **Set your minimum cart value.** Enter the minimum amount of cart value that a shopper must have to receive an abandoned cart text message. The default is 1, which means anyone who has any value in their cart should receive the text. 
  2. **Set a maximum cart value (optional).** Check the box to expand the option to set a maximum cart value. Use this if you plan on making tiered offers to customers with different cart values.
  3. **Segment your audience by their product interests (Shopify only)**. Using your product IDs, determine the product(s) that the customer must have in their cart to receive the text. More information on locating your IDs and using product segmentation is available [here](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/192-use-product-segmentation).
  4. **Set the timing of your text message.** Using the _Hours since last seen_ field, choose how much time must pass since a shopper's visit before your abandoned cart text is sent to them. The default setting is one hour but can be as long as 2 days (48 hours). 
  5. Once you finish configuring your settings, click **Save Changes**.

## Coupon settings (optional)

  * **Select a coupon code**. If you're using the _Coupon Code_ personalization token, like in the example below, select an existing coupon from the dropdown menu. If none are available, select the **Create more coupons** option instead. Information on creating coupons is available [here](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/72-create-and-manage-coupon-codes). 

    
    
    Hey {{ contact.first_name }}! We noticed you left something in your cart. Still interested? Use code {{ coupon_code }} for 10% off your entire order. Hurry, items sell out quickly! {{ cart.url }}
    

  * Once you finish selecting your coupon, click **Save Changes**.

# Send a text

  * **Activate your text(s).** Once your message(s) are ready, select the **Activate** button at the top of the editor. Moving forward, the text(s) will be sent to all eligible contacts who meet the criteria you set when creating the content.

# Review a text's performance

After an abandoned cart text is enabled, its performance gets tracked on the
[Abandoned Cart Messages](https://dashboard.privy.com/abandoned-cart-emails)
dashboard and in an individual delivery report. The available metrics between
the two reporting options include how many messages were sent, delivered, and
clicked along with the number of carts saved and the revenue generated by the
saves.

  * In your Privy account, click the **Automations** option in the main navigation. 
  * Locate the text message you'd like to review. The message's overall performance metrics are listed on the dashboard. Select the message to open the message's delivery report.

  * By default, the text's performance displays using percentages. To reveal the exact number that the percentages represent, hover over the bars in the chart.
