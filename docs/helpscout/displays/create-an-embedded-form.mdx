Embedded forms are used to gather information about your visitors and
customers. The main feature of this type of display is that it's fixed
directly or "embedded" on the page of your website. This presentation differs
from most Privy displays that are associated with a display animation, such as
sliding in or popping up.

# Follow-up the display

To sync the display's signups to another service or send a follow-up message
to the customers who submitted the display, move to the Follow-up step and
review the options below. Please note that accounts created before May 26,
2022, won't automatically enable after signup emails. Instead, you must
manually switch the **Published** toggle to the ON position.

  1. [After-signup emails](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/166-set-up-an-after-signup-email) are enabled by default on active displays, meaning that they will immediately start sending to new signups if the following criteria are met:

    * The display contains an email field and a [coupon code](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/72-create-and-manage-coupon-codes).
    * The account has a _Website URL_ address set on its [Business Information](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/business-info) page. 
    * The display type is not [Phone Capture](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/199-create-a-phone-capture-display) or [Two-Step](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/93-create-a-two-step-display).

  2. Select the **Sync signups** option to sync the signups to a list in a [linked account](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts). If you're not using [Privy Email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/46-get-started-privy-email), this setting is particularly important as it ensures the contact information (e.g., email address) is available to the third-party provider.
  3. Select the **Send text message** option to send an[ after-signup text message](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/242-set-up-an-after-signup-text) to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display.
  4. Enable or disable real-time notifications for your users. These notifications will alert the user of new display signups immediately. **Save**. 

**Note:** The text option requires a [Privy Text](https://www.privy.com/text)
subscription. Customers are only eligible to receive texts if their phone
number was collected via a Privy display using the phone field, they checked
the text opt-in checkbox, and they answered "YES" to the double opt-in message
sent to their number.

# Launch the display

Once the display has been created, the target audience selected, and any
desired follow-up messages configured, select the **Publish** button at the
upper right of the _Follow-up step_ and confirm your decision in the prompt.

# Embed the form on your site

To retrieve the embed code once the display is published:

  * Navigate back to the _Create_ step. 
  * Click the**< /> Get embed code** button and copy the appropriate value.

  * Paste the embed code into the HTML of your external page. Here's an example of how to [add a form to your Shopify footer](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/48-add-a-form-to-your-shopify-footer).
