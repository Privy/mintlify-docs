An exit-intent display is a marketing message displayed to a website visitor
who's just about to leave your website or storefront. The display is triggered
when visitors move their mouse to leave or close the page. This display type
is highly encouraged as it gives you one last chance to convince your visitor
to stay on your website, complete their purchase, or provide a way to keep in
touch.

# Create the display

The quickest and easiest way to create an exit-intent display is via Privy's
pre-built [plays](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/181-should-i-use-a-
play-or-build-my-own-display), as outlined in this section. That said, you can
still create an exit-intent display from scratch by following the manual steps
instead. To create an exit-intent display with Plays:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and click the **New Display** button.
  * On the Templates dashboard, select the**Stop Abandonment** option, decide which template option is best for you 
  * Click **Get Started** on the chosen Template to start editing

  * If you are okay using the default targeting rules and settings in the Template, which represents the top-performing displays from across Privy's customer base, hit Publish to get the display live on your site. However, if you'd like to review or reconfigure any of the template's settings, including its coupon, targeting rules, or follow-up actions, select the **Save** option instead. 

## Reconfigure the Template

To edit the template's default settings, check out the resources below:

### Add or edit an incentive

To edit the coupon settings of the exit-intent display:

  * Navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. 
  * Scroll down to and click the **Coupon** card and select one from the dropdown menu. If none are available, create one by following [these steps](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/72-create-and-manage-coupon-codes). 
  * The **Create** step will include a Thank You Page Design option with a coupon selected. Click this option to customize how the coupon code is displayed to visitors who submit the exit-intent display. **Save** any changes.

With the incentive added, you can continue customizing the display's settings
or move to the **Follow-up** step of the display builder and publish the
display.

### Edit the display targeting

To change the targeting conditions of the exit-intent display:

  * Navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. 
  * Click the **Audience Targeting** card, edit the targeting conditions to your liking by following [these steps](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-conditions), and **Save** any changes. 

With the targeting conditions updated, you can continue customizing the
display's settings or move to the **Follow-up** step of the display builder
and publish the display.

### Sync signups

To sync signups collected by the exit-intent display to another service:

  * Navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. 
  * Click on **Show Advanced Settings** at the bottom right of the page. 
  * Click the **Sync Integrations** button, select one of your [linked accounts](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts) from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**. 

With the after signup settings updated, you can continue customizing the
display's settings or publish the display from the **Follow-up** step.

# Launch the display

Once the display has been created, the target audience selected, and any
desired follow-up messages configured, select the **Publish** button at the
upper right of the  _Follow-up step_ and confirm your decision in the prompt.
