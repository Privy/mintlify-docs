A welcome discount display appears as soon as your visitor arrives or shortly
after their arrival. Its main goal is to grab visitors' attention and entice
them to provide their contact information. Most first-time visitors aren't
going to make a purchase when they first explore your site, so this is a
significant opportunity to connect with the visitor and stay in touch. Every
email you capture is worth, on average, $33 in future sales.

## Before you begin

A welcome discount display uses a discount offer to entice visitors to submit
their contact information. Please [create a
coupon](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/72-create-and-manage-coupon-
codes) before starting the steps outlined below. If you do not, you will be
prompted to do so during setup and will need to restart the display creation
process.

# Create the display

To create a welcome discount display:

  * Navigate to **Convert > All Displays** and click the **New Display** button. 
  * On the _Templates_ dashboard, you can select either or both **Collect Email Subscribers** and**Collect SMS Subscribers.** Choose the template you'd like to use, click **Get Started** , and proceed to customize the display using the designer to match your branding and style.

  * This action opens the display editor, where you'll see a default layout as a starting point for your display's design.
  * Use the display editor to customize the display's content, tabs, and thank you page to match your brand. You can access each component of the display via the _Displays_ menu and can easily edit each element of a display by selecting areas of the preview.

  * Next, use the **Desktop Preview** and **Mobile Preview** buttons to ensure the display meets your design goals for each view. All layouts are designed for desktop and mobile responsiveness by default; however, it's always best to check.

  * The display is ready to collect visitor information. To launch it on your site, use the **Publish** button at the top right. If you aren't ready to publish or want to customize the display's settings, such as the targeting and after-signup actions, select **Save** instead.

# Target the right audience

As with all Privy plays, a recommended target audience has already been
selected for your display. In this case, a welcome discount appears after 10
seconds to new visitors who haven't previously submitted a display a maximum
of once per day until the display is disabled. To change these default
settings, click on the appropriate card and update the settings.

  1. **Triggers and Visibility** determine when and how the display appears to the visitor. 
  2. **Audience Targeting** targets the specific segment of visitors outlined in the section above. Learn more about [attributes, activities, and behaviors](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-conditions). 
  3. **Scheduling** determines how long the display will appear to visitors. Update the setting if you'd like the display to expire on a specific fixed date. 
  4. The**Coupon** setting allows you to change the coupon associated with the display.

If you make any changes to these settings, be sure to click **Save.**

### **Advanced Settings**

Advanced settings give you even more control over the behavior of your
display.

Contacts become mailable upon form submission. _Double Opt-in_ \- Send new contacts an opt-in confirmation email upon signup. Contacts become mailable after they confirm via email.

# Follow-up the display

Move to the _Follow-up_ step, and review the following optional options:

  1. Enable and customize the [default after signup email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/166-set-up-an-after-signup-email) to send an email to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display. 
  2. Select the **Add Email to Series** option to send additional after-signup emails. 
  3. Select the **Create After Sign Up** option to send an[ after signup text message](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/242-set-up-an-after-signup-text) to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display. 

**Note:** The text message option requires a [Privy
Text](https://www.privy.com/pricing) subscription. Additionally, a customer is
only eligible to receive texts if their phone number was collected via a Privy
display using the phone field, they checked the text opt-in checkbox, and they
answered "YES" to the double opt-in message sent to their number.
