You can add a link to images in your Privy displays so visitors will be
brought to a different page when they click the image. This functionality
allows you to create all kinds of creative calls-to-action, such as directing
visitors to your social accounts, as shown in the example below.

To add a link to an image in your display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and choose or create a display. 
  * In the **Create** step of the display builder, select the **Design** card to open the display editor. The card is labeled with the type of display you've selected (e.g., Popup or Spin to Win). 
  * In the display designer, add a new image or select an existing image from the preview. In the sidebar, input the desired destination into the **Image Link** field.

  * Once you've made your changes, select **Save** at the top-right. 

All set! The display image is updated with a link. If your display is already
published, the changes will go into effect immediately and redirect visitors
that click the image.
