Scheduling allows you to set up a display so that it becomes available and
expires at predetermined times. The functionality makes creating and executing
multiple displays much easier, especially during the busy season.

**Note:** Display schedules rely on the time zone set in the [Business
Information](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/business-info) settings of
your account. Please make sure to adjust your publish date and time to
accommodate any differences in your account's time zone compared to the target
market (e.g., 3 PM EDT = 12 PM PDT).

# Create a schedule

To schedule a display:

  * Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays**. 
  * Locate and select the display that you'd like to schedule. 
  * Select the **Settings** step in the display editor and click on the **Scheduling** card.
  * Enable the **Fixed** option in the _Signup Period_ area and then select the desired _Start_ and _End_ dates before ultimately clicking **Save**. 

If the display has already been published, it will move to a Scheduled status,
and no additional action is required. If the display is a draft, you will
still need to publish the display for the schedule to take effect. Don't
worry! A reminder prompt appears if this action is required.

# Change a schedule

To change the scheduling constraints previously applied to a display:

  * Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays**. 
  * Locate and select the display that you'd like to schedule. 
  * Select the **Settings** step in the display editor and click on the **Scheduling** card.
  * Update the _Start_ and _End_ dates before ultimately clicking **Save**. 

The countdown to publishing will update at the top right once the new schedule
is saved. For example, the update shown below increases the countdown from 1
day to 7 days.

# Remove a schedule

Once a schedule has been applied to a display, it cannot be removed. To
prevent a scheduled publish, change the schedule, copy the display, and delete
the original.
