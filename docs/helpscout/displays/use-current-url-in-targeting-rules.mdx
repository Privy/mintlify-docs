Privy's audience targeting rules are a collection of conditions that allow you
to target individuals with specific displays so that you can display the right
message to the right person at the right time. The 'Current URL' condition is
particularly powerful as it empowers you to craft specific messaging or offers
based on where the customer is within your business's customer journey.

Here are a few use cases for you to consider:

  * Offer a product-specific discount
  * Recommend similar or complementary product to the one they're viewing
  * Drive sales through your blog by showing blog readers a product related to the post

**Note:** For security reasons, Shopify blocks third-party apps, such as
Privy, from running on checkout pages. Displays targeting a "checkout" page
will not work.

# Create the targeting rules

### How to Add the 'Current URL' property into your "Build Your Own" display's
audience targeting rules:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**.
  * Select or create a display you would like to update. 
  * In the **Settings** step, select the **Audience Targeting** card.
  * Click the dropdown menu listed under the _Property_ header and select the **Current URL** option from the _Website Behavior_ section. 
  * Next, choose the operator and the value that you'd like the rule to evaluate.
    * **Contains/Does not contain** : any contacts who are or aren't viewing a page that contains a specified part of a URL. For example, entering contains /shirts will show the display to contacts viewing any website page that contains /shirts in the page URL, such as http://www.domain.com/mens_clothing/shirts. 
    * **Equals/Does not equal** : any contacts who are or aren't viewing a page that matches/doesn't match the exact URL specifiedâ€”for example, http://www.domain.com/pricing/. 
    * **Is/Is not the homepage** : any contacts who are or aren't viewing your site's homepage. For example, the display would appear on http://www.domain.com/ but not on http://www.domain.com/pricing. 
    * **Matches or does not match regex** : This is an advanced function that should only be implemented by users who are familiar with regular expressions. RegExr is a helpful website for learning, building, and testing regular expressions. 
  * Finalize any additional rules and select **Save**.

# See it In Action

Great work! This display will now only appear to contacts who meet the
provided criteria. For example, this cross-sell display appears to visitors
viewing the 'Energy' candle and encourages them to check out the store's
premium matches as well.
