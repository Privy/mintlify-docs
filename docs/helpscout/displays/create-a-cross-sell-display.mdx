A cross-sell encourages or incentivizes customers to add additional items or
upgrades to their cart before they finalize their purchase. When a cross-sell
keeps the customer's experience and goals in mind, it has the potential to
benefit both you and the customer tremendously. You can increase your average
order value and revenue while the customer receives an add-on that complements
their current need.

# Shopify Cross Sell

As this section outlines, the quickest way to create a cross-sell display is
via Privy's pre-built
[Templates](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/181-should-i-use-a-play-
or-build-my-own-display).

To create a Shopify cross-sell display:

  * Navigate to **Convert > All Displays** and click the **New Display** button. 
  * On the _Templates_ dashboard, select the**Increase Order Value** option, select the template you'd like to use, click **Get Started** , and proceed to customize the display using the designer to match your branding and style.

## Reconfigure the Template

Edit the display targeting

To change the targeting conditions of the cross-sell display:

  * Navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. 
  * Click the **Audience Targeting** card, edit the targeting conditions to your liking by following [these steps](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-conditions), and **Save** any changes. 

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/6606da67f4bb664508693b91/images/6683049cdd0f8c60bb3fdcb1/file-
DRYRpnslIA.png)

With the targeting conditions updated, you can continue customizing the
display's settings or select the **Publish** button to activate the display.

# Shopify cross-sell (manual)

If you intend to modify the settings of the pre-built Template heavily, then
starting from scratch might be a better option for you. To create a cross-sell
display while integrated with Shopify from scratch:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and click on the **New Display** button. 
  * On the _Templates_ dashboard, select Get Started under the "Prefer the classic creation experience?" card on the bottom right of the page, provide an internal name, and then click the **Create Display** button. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the desired**Form fields** and **Validations** for the display if you hope to collect signups. One field is recommended, while the validation depends on your intended audiences and desired discount availability. If the display is for an announcement and doesn't need a form element, disable the **Enable Form?** option.

  * While still in the _Create_ step, select the **Add a Display** option. 
  * Select a form-free or cross-sell display template to showcase your items - a **flyout** or a **banner** is recommended - and then click the **Choose selected** option in the upper right. 
  * Customize the display with an image from your Shopify catalog or computer and an add-to-cart button for each product. For the button action, select the **Add Shopify product to cart** option and then the associated (e.g., pictured) product from the dropdown menu. 
  * Select the **Save** option at the upper right.

  * Next, move to the  _Target_ step and switch the **When To Show** setting to 3 or 5 seconds. **Save**. 
  * Select the **Who To Show It To** setting and click **Add targeting condition**.
  * Add the two rules listed below with an **AND** operator and **Save**. 
    * **Cart value is greater than 1** \- This rule ensures a product is in the customer's cart.
    * **Cart Product IDs contains any of ()** \- This rule ensures the customer has products in their cart that complement the cross-sell. Alternatively, you could also use a "does not contain" version if you'd simply like to bring attention to products that aren't in the customer's cart. New products or best-sellers often have this wider and more general appeal. 
  * Select the **How Long to Show It** setting if you'd like the cross-sell to expire. **Save**. 
  * In the upper right, click the **Publish** button and confirm in the prompt.

## Shopify Cart URLs & Variant IDs

To manually create a button that automatically adds a Shopify product to a
shopper's cart:

  * Navigate to your Shopify admin and view a product.
  * Add **.xml** to the end of the URL and refresh your browser. 
  * On the subsequent XML page, locate the **Variants** section and copy the **id type= "integer" **value for the desired variant. If you have multiple [variants](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/os/using-themes/change-the-layout/find-variant-id), each will have its own variant section with unique values (e.g., IDs, Title/Name, Price, etc.).

  * Incorporate your store name and the desired variant ID into the permalink below. 

    
    
    http://my-store.com/cart/add?id=123456789&quantity=1
    

  * Use this customized link in the **Redirect page to** button action and **Save**.

  * Continue with the _Target_ steps outlined above. The **Cart** **Product IDs contains any of ()** targeting rules and can also use manually retrieved variant IDs if the desired product from your catalog does not appear in the dropdown menu.

# BigCommerce Cart URLs & Product IDs

## Create an add-to-cart URL

To automatically add a product to a shopper's cart and take them directly to
the cart page, include **/cart.php?action=add &product_id=(product number
here)** after your store's domain. [Learn
more](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-
management/carts/items#update-cart-line-item).

    
    
    store-name.com/cart.php?action=add&product_id=1234567890
    

## Locate a product ID

In your store admin, the product ID is the number near the end of the URL:

    
    
    https://store-name.mybigcommerce.com/manage/products/1234567890/edit
    

Follow these steps to locate the ID(s) in your BigCommerce account:
