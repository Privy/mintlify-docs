The [after-signup](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/166-set-up-an-
after-signup-email) email is a one-time email sent to contacts after they've
signed up for your display. Typically, an after-signup email isn't sent
because it hasn't been properly enabled, as it is disabled by default.

# Troubleshoot after signup emails

To ensure a display has an after-signup email enabled:

  * Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays** via the main navigation. 
  * Select the display in need of an after-signup email. 
  * Select the **Follow-Up** step in the display builder. 
  * Enable the desired email(s) by switching the **Status** toggle to the _Active_ position. If the display is active, the email(s) will start sending to contacts who submit the display immediately. Make sure your content is customer-ready before taking this action.

**Note:** Enabling an after-signup email on an active display **will not**
retroactively send the email to contacts who have already signed up via the
display.
