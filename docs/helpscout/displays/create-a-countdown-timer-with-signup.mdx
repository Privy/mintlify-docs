A countdown timer is a virtual clock set to expire at a given time, usually
indicating the beginning or end of an offer. The display helps generate
awareness while creating a sense of urgency and scarcity that encourages
shoppers to expedite their purchase decision. Countdown timers are an
essential component of any business' conversion rate optimization (CRO)
strategy, as they leverage the innate power of FOMO (fear of missing out) to
generate more conversions.

# Target the right audience

As with all Privy [Templates](https://help.privy.com/article/97-overview-of-
the-plays-dashboard), a recommended target audience has already been selected
for your display. In this case, a countdown timer with signup appears
_immediately for all audiences_(everyone). To change these default settings,
click on the appropriate card and update the settings.

  1. **Triggers and Visibility** determine when and how the display appears to the visitor. 
  2. **Audience Targeting** targets the specific segment of visitors outlined in the section above. Learn more about [attributes, activities, and behaviors](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-conditions). 
  3. **Scheduling** determines how long the display will appear to visitors and serves as the end of your countdown. Update the setting to display the timer on your design. 
  4. The optional**Coupon** setting allows you to change the coupon associated with the display
