A banner display appears from the top or bottom of the web page and can remain
visible as your visitors navigate around. The dynamic movement is a great way
to get your visitors' attention. Simultaneously, the larger display size
allows you to incorporate an image or multi-field form element, unlike a more
streamlined [bar display](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/147-create-
a-bar-display).

examples](https://www.privy.com/customer-examples).

# Create the display

To create a banner display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and click on the **New Display** button. 
  * On the _Templates_ dashboard, select Get Started under the "Prefer the classic creation experience?" card on the bottom right of the page, provide an internal name, and then click the **Create Display** button. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the desired**Form fields** and **Validations** for the display if you hope to collect signups. One field is recommended, while the validation depends on your intended audiences and desired discount availability. If the display is for an announcement and doesn't need a form element, disable the **Enable Form?** option.

EpL2yzQRyx.gif)

  * Next, select the **Add a Display** option. 
  * Select **Banner** from the sidebar, choose a template to customize, and then click the **Choose Selected** option in the upper right. 
  * Use the [display designer](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/100-use-the-build-your-own-display-designer) to configure the display to your liking.
  * Select the **Save** option at the upper right when you are done with your changes. 

**Note:** To change where the banner displays, update the tab location via the
**Tab Design** option or the display editor's **Desktop tab** option. Tab
locations on the left, right, or top will result in a banner that sticks to
the top of the page. Meanwhile, locations on the bottom will result in a
banner sticking to the page's bottom.

  * After saving, a new _Banner Design_ section will be available under the _Create_ tab. It's best practice to use a thank-you page after the sign-up action; however, you can opt to redirect the user or do nothing instead. 
  * If the banner offers a discount, make sure to select a coupon from the _Coupon codes_ section and include the {{ signup.coupon_code }} merge tag in the thank-you page or the after-signup message. This tag populates with your coupon code information automatically and ensures the selected coupon is provided to the visitor.

# Target the right audience

By default, a banner display appears to all visitors at all times until it is
dismissed. To change any of these default options, move to the _Target_ step,
and customize the desired settings.

  1. The **When To Show** setting allows you to determine when and how often the display appears to visitors. After making any changes, please select **Save**. 
  2. The **Who To Show It To** setting allows you to target a more specific segment of your visitors instead of all visitors. If you update these settings to include various other [attributes, activities, and behaviors](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-conditions), please select **Save**. 
  3. The **How Long to Show It** setting determines how long the display will appear to visitors. Update the setting if you'd like the display to expire on a specific fixed date then **Save**. 

**Note:** To make the banner appear throughout an entire visit, set the "When
To Show" setting to **Immediately** and the "Trigger Automatically at Most"
setting to **No Limit**.

# Follow-up the display

To sync the display's signups to another service or send a follow-up message
to the customers who submitted the display, move to the _Follow-up_ step and
review the following optional options:

  1. Enable and customize the [default after-signup email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/166-set-up-an-after-signup-email) to send an email to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display. 
  2. Select the **Create series** option to send additional after-signup emails. 
  3. Select the **Sync signups** option to sync the signups to a list in a [linked account](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts). If you're not using [Privy Email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/46-get-started-privy-email), this setting is particularly important as it ensures the contact information (e.g., email address) is available to the third-party provider.
  4. Select the **Send text message** option to send an[ after-signup text message](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/242-set-up-an-after-signup-text) to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display. 
  5. The **Notifications** setting allows you to enable or disable real-time notifications for your users. These notifications will alert the user of new display signups immediately. If you make any changes, please select **Save**.

**Note:** The text message option requires a [Privy
Text](https://www.privy.com/pricing) subscription. Additionally, a customer is
only eligible to receive texts if their phone number was collected via a Privy
display using the phone field, they checked the text opt-in checkbox, and they
answered "YES" to the double opt-in message sent to their number.

# Launch the display

Once the display has been created, the target audience selected, and any
desired follow-up messages configured, select the **Publish** button at the
upper right of the  _Follow-up step_ and confirm your decision in the prompt.

The banner display is now live and will appear to your qualifying customers.
