If you've decided to offer a discount to encourage conversion or reward
customer loyalty, it's also worth considering making the redemption process as
easy as possible. A "coupon" link does just that. It automatically applies the
associated discount to the customer's cart, simplifying the checkout
procedures, enhancing the customer's experience, and allowing the customer to
buy quickly.

Note: This functionality is only available for accounts with a Shopify
integration. For now, the Classic Display builder must be used in order to
apply coupon codes automatically.

  

We are working on adding this functionality to the current Display Builder.

#  Create a link

Your discount link must follow the URL format outlined below:

    
    
    https://my-store.com/discount/{{signup.coupon_code}}?redirect=/cart
    

Please make sure to replace **my-store.com** with your domain.

# Use the link

Now that you have the link ready to go, it can be used to automatically apply
the coupon after an individual submits a display or after they click a
hyperlinked piece of display content.

## Apply after a sign-up

To apply a code immediately upon the submission of a display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**. 
  * Select or create a display to associate with the "coupon" link. 
  * Go to the **Create** step of the display builder and locate the **After Signup Action** section. This section is only available if a display has been added to the display. 
  * Choose the **Redirect to URL** option and paste the URL you have created.
  * Select the **Save Changes** button and finish configuring the display as usual.

The display will now redirect the individual to their cart and apply the
discount automatically at checkout.

## Apply after a click

To apply a code immediately following a click:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**.
  * Select or create a display to associate with the "coupon" link. 
  * Go to the **Create** step of the display builder and locate the **Thank You Page Design** section. This section is only available if a display with form fields has been added to the display, and the display's  _After Signup_ action is set to **Show Thank You Page**. 
  * In the editor, select the **{{coupon_code }}** liquid variable that Privy uses to populate your coupon code into your thank-you page. Then click on the hyperlink option to link the highlighted liquid variable text.
  * In the prompt, paste the URL you created earlier and confirm by clicking **Insert Link**.
  * Design the rest of the thank-you page, select the **Save** button at the top-right, and finish configuring the display as usual.

Following a click, the link will redirect the individual to their cart and
automatically apply the discount at checkout.
