Form validations allow you to determine who is eligible to submit a display
and how many submissions a display will accept. Validations are essential when
a display is tied to a limited giveaway or meant only to target new customers.

# Validation options

The validation options available for forms are:

  1. **Limit one signup per contact** : This validation prevents your contact from signing up more than once with the same email address or phone number. If a contact attempts to signup again, they will receive a "You're already signed up!" warning prompt, and the signup will be rejected. 
  2. **New contacts only** : This validation only allows someone to sign up for the display if their email or phone number is not already associated with a contact profile in your Privy account. A contact profile is generated with this information if the contact has previously submitted another display, the contact was created manually via the Contacts dashboard, or the contact was imported. If existing contacts attempt to signup, they will receive a "Sorry, this is only available to first-time customers." warning prompt, and the signup will be rejected. 
  3. **Automatically end the display after () signups** : This validation ends the display after X number of signups. Once the limit is reached, your display will no longer display on your website or storefront. 

**Note:** All displays will limit contacts to one signup (submission) by
default.

# Example use-cases

Check out a brief example leveraging each of the available validation rules
below:

## Limit one signup per contact

All displays limit contacts to one signup (submission) by default. However,
you may want to disable this setting when it's expected that contacts would
submit the display multiple times. For example, a landing page offering a
guide or white paper related to one of your products or services.

## New contacts only

This validation only allows someone to sign up for the display if their email
or phone number is not already associated with a contact profile in your Privy
account. The setting is particularly useful when you'd like to ensure an offer
is only claimed by new contacts.

For example, you may use [audience
targeting](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-
conditions) to restrict a display to visitors who have never seen a previous
display and assume that only new customers would meet these conditions.
However, that is not the case. It would be possible for an existing (known)
contact to submit the display if they aren't tagged with a Privy cookie. This
can happen if a contact clears their cookies or visits from a new browser.
Additionally, someone who was manually created or imported would not be
associated with a cookie if they haven't subsequently visited your site and
submitted a display.

Regardless of the situation, the "New contacts only" rule prevents non-cookied
known contacts from claiming the offer by rejecting the submission based on
the provided contact information.

## Automatically end the display after

This validation ends the display after X number of signups. The setting is
perfect for offers limited by quantityâ€”for example, a free item giveaway for
the first 100 signups.
