Social media platforms help you connect with your customers, increase your
brand awareness, and boost your number of qualified leads.

With billions of people worldwide using social media every month, the users
and engagement on major platforms continue to increase. A "follow us" display
helps you tap into these communities and grow your social following by
encouraging your customers to visit your social pages and follow or like the
accounts. An example is available below:

# Best practices

Some best practices shown or used in the example above and recommended for
your "follow us" displays include:

  * **Use a clear and relevant call-to-action** : Refrain from using a generic headline like, “Follow us on Twitter” - instead, relate the headline to the topic of your page, article, or blog post. Tell your visitors what they will get in return for liking or following your social accounts. 
  * **Include social proof** : Individuals trust earned media, such as a recommendation from a friend or peer, above all other forms of advertising. An easy way to convey social proof is to show your visitors that their peers (e.g., fellow customers) like and/or follow your brand on social media. 
  * **Make the choice easy** : Don’t overwhelm and ultimately dissuade your visitors by presenting too many options. Pick one or two social networks to make their choice easier. 
  * **Target engaged/interested visitors** : A "follow us" display is most effective when displayed on informative content that implies a certain level of visitor interest. These sources include your blog, resource offers, and promotional landing pages. Additionally, a scroll trigger of at least 50% or a timer of at least 5 seconds is recommended. 

# Create the display

To create a "follow us" display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and click on the **New Display** button. 
  * On the _Templates_ dashboard, select **Get Started** under the "Prefer the classic creation experience?" card on the bottom right of the page, provide an internal name, and then click the **Create Display** button. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the desired**Form fields** and **Validations** for the display if you hope to collect signups. One field is recommended, while the validation depends on your intended audiences and desired discount availability. Lastly, disable the **Enable Form?** option.

  * While still in the _Create_ step, select the **Add a Display** option. 
  * Select a form-free display template to showcase your "follow us" call to action - a **flyout** or a **popup** is recommended - and then click the **Choose selected** option in the upper right. 
  * Use the [display designer](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/100-use-the-build-your-own-display-designer) to configure the display to your liking. While effective designs vary greatly, make sure to include an **Image** element that links to the desired social account(s). Icons are available for download from various sources, like [this one](https://www.iconfinder.com/social-media-icons?price=free&order_by=latest), or can be created manually. 
  * Select the **Save** option at the upper right when you are done with your changes.

# Target the right audience

A "follow us" display is most effective when displayed on informative content
that implies a certain level of visitor interest. These sources include your
blog, resource offers, and promotional landing pages. Additionally, a scroll
trigger of at least 50% or a timer of at least 5 seconds is recommended. To
customize these options, move to the _Target_ step and set the desired
settings.

  1. The **When To Show** setting allows you to determine when and how often the display appears to visitors. If you make any changes, please select **Save**. 
  2. The **Who To Show It To** setting allows you to target a more specific segment of your visitors instead of all visitors. If you update these settings to include various other [attributes, activities, and behaviors](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/229-use-display-triggers), please select **Save**. 
  3. The **How Long to Show It** setting determines how long the display will appear to visitors. Update the setting if you'd like the display to expire on a specific fixed date and **Save**.

# Launch the display

Once the display has been created and the target audience selected, select the
**Publish** button at the upper right of the display builder and confirm your
decision in the prompt.

The "follow us" display is now live and will appear to your qualifying
customers.
