The Classic Editor tool offers various[ display
types](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/161-privy-display-types) and
[templates](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/153-create-and-manage-
email-templates) that can be customized in various ways. If you've designed a
display and decide to take it in another direction, its type or template can
be quickly changed via the display builder.

**Note:** All previous content and design work **are lost** when the display
is swapped.

# Change the display type

To update the display type or template associated with a
"[Classic](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/100-use-the-build-your-own-
display-designer)" display:

  * Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays** via the main navigation. 
  * Select the Classic display you want to update to open the display builder. 
  * Select the **Create** tab and click on the current design card (e.g., Popup, Banner, etc.). 
  * Review the existing display and copy/paste any content you'd like to save or reference to an external source. Once a new display type is selected, this content will be reset. 
  * Select the **Templates** > **Choose a template** from the dropdown menu at the top-right. 
  * Select a new design and click the **Choose selected** button at the top-right. 
  * Confirm your decision and acknowledge that previous content is overwritten via the prompt.

That's it! The display type or template has been changed. Using the [display
