Privy users can redirect visitors to a specific page after submitting the
Convert display's form component. For example, if they sign up for a discount
on your home page, you can send them to a featured product page or directly to
their cart [with the coupon
applied](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/167-automatically-apply-
coupon-codes). Or, if you are offering a piece of [gated
content](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/230-how-to-gate-content-with-
privy), you can automatically send them to that piece of content once they
have submitted their information.

  * Navigate to the **Create** step of the display builder.
