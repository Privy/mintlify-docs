Your account's timezone displays dates and times for all tracked events and is
referenced by the Convert, Email, and Text tools when sending or scheduling
content. If your timezone is improperly set, this may skew how you view
tracked activities and result in displays going out at unexpected times. To
review and update these settings for your account:

  * Select the **Account** dropdown menu at the top-right. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * Locate the **Business Timezone** setting under the _Business Information_ header. If you need to update the timezone, click the dropdown menu, select a new timezone, and then scroll down to select the **Save Changes** button. 

**Note:** The _Business Timezone_ setting applies to the entire account and
isn't available on a per-user basis. Please ensure that your users factor in
any differences in the account's timezone compared to their local time or
desired target market for their displays or messaging.
