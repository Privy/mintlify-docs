An 'Unauthorized' error indicates that Privy cannot connect to a linked
account with the provided credentials. Any of the following scenarios can
trigger this error type:

  * Updating the password or email address used to access the linked account.
  * Deleting or editing an API key in the linked account.
  * Revoking the permissions granted to Privy by the linked account.
  * Uninstalling Privy from the linked account.
  * The end of a trial period.

If any of these situations have occurred, displays that were previously synced
to the linked account via the display's  _Follow-Up_ settings will fail until
the issue is resolved. Additionally, if the error is tied to your e-commerce
platform, displays will likely no longer be visible on your site. This is
because store apps (e.g., Shopify) are typically responsible for incorporating
the Privy code into your site content. If the code was installed manually,
displays would continue to appear.

# Check a connection

If one of your linked accounts is experiencing an 'Unauthorized" error, you
will likely see a prompt on the dashboard, the _Follow-Up_ step of the display
builder, or when creating a coupon. That said, if you suspect an issue and
haven't seen an error message, you can manually test an account's connection.
To test a linked account's connection to Privy:

  * Select the **Account** dropdown menu at the top-right. 
  * Select the **Integrations** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the _Authorized Accounts_ section, select the **Test Account** button.

If the connection is valid, a Connection Successful message will appear. If
the connection is broken, then a Connection Failed message will appear. To
restore a failed connection, follow the steps below.

# Identify the cause

Identify the most likely issue by reviewing the wording of any provided error
messages and/or the list of likely scenarios listed in this guide's
introduction. If none of these seem to fit your situation, check out [Privy's
Status Page](https://status.privy.com/) and the affected linked account's
status page to ensure there aren't broader platform issues on either side.

# Resolve the error

To resolve an 'Unauthorized' error and restore the connection between Privy
and the linked account:

  * Navigate to the [Authorized Accounts](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts) section of your Privy settings. 
  * Select the **Delete**() button next to the affected account and refresh the page. 
  * After a page refresh, locate the desired provider, select it, and provide updated credentials. 

The selected provider should now appear as a linked account in the
_Authorized Accounts_ section. With a new connection established, please make
sure to review the displays that previously synced to this account and ensure
the **Sync Integrations** settings are properly configured.
