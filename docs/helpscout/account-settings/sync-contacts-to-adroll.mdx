account, you must link (integrate) the two accounts and add automation rules
to your displays.

  * Select the**Integrations** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * Scroll down to the _Available Integrations_ section and select the **Adroll** option.

  * Enter your credentials in the prompt and then select **Link Account**. To locate your Advertiser ID in Adroll, go to the left navigation menu and click **Website** under _Audiences_. From there, scroll down to the dashboard's AdRoll Pixel section and click **View Pixel**. The ID will be listed as a variable using the format _adroll_adv_id_.

All set! Adroll should now appear as a linked account in the _Authorized
Accounts_ section. It's time to add some automation rules.

# Add an automation rule

**Note:** These settings must be set for each display individually. Displays
syncing to Adroll sync every 100 signups and does not sync individual signups
due to Adroll API restrictions. Manual exports also count towards this sync
limit.

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to
Adroll:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**. 
  * Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. The selected display must include a form to sync contacts. 
  * Click the **Sync signups** button, select**Adroll** from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**.

This display's signups will now sync to Adroll. Click the **Sync signups**
button to sync contacts to additional services or lists. Check out [this
