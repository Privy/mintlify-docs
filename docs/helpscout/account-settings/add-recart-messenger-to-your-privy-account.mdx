**Note:** Recart establishes this connection, and their support and success
teams will be your best resource for implementing the messenger opt-in to your
Privy displays.

**How does it work?**

  1. The Recart Success Team establishes the connection by adding Messenger widgets to your active popups. 
  2. The Messenger widget only shows up on your display if Recart detects an active Facebook login in the browser (to avoid driving your customers to the Facebook login page).
  3. In case the Messenger widget is live, both email and Messenger are required for subscription. 

**How can I get started?**

Please reach out to the Recart Success Team and let them know what Privy
display(s) you want to integrate with the Recart Messenger. Refer to[ the
guide published by
Recart](https://help.recart.com/en/articles/3277853-integrate-recart-into-
privy-justuno-klaviyo-and-other-popups) for more information on adding the
Recart Messenger Widget to Privy displays.
