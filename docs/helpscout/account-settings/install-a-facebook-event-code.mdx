To track contacts that visit your site from a Facebook ad and then sign up via
a Privy form, you can install a [Facebook event
code](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755?id=1205376682832142)
on the pages that include your Privy Convert displays. The code will allow you
to track these "leads" in your Facebook Ads account.

**Note:** To use Facebook event codes, you must have installed the Facebook
Ads tracking pixel. Information on installing third-party pixels is available
[here](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/165-install-tracking-codes-
pixels).

# Copy the event code

To start triggering and tracking these events, you will need to copy this
code:

    
    
    <script>
    
    fbq('track', 'Lead');
    
    </script>
    

# Install the event code

To install the event code:

  * Select the **Account** option from the navigation bar. Your business name appears here. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Customizations** under the  _Business Settings_ section.
  * Paste the copied event code into the **Conversion Pixels** area. 
  * Select the **Save Changes** option at the bottom of the page.

**Note:** Privy will now fire the pixel after every new form submission. After
around 24 hours, you should begin to see lead counts increment in Facebook
ads.
