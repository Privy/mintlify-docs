If you're already using Privy's onsite displays to grow your contact list, you
should also consider replacing any forms (e.g., Newsletter) in the body
content of your Wix store with one from Privy. This replacement ensures that
all your contacts - wherever they sign up on your site - sync with your Privy
account and its [linked
accounts](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts).

# Before you begin

  * The Privy code must already be [installed on your Wix site](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/109-install-privy-on-wix). 
  * You must use a Classic Display in order to use an embedded form

# Configuration

The embed process depends on [the editor you've
chosen](https://support.wix.com/en/article/adi-moving-from-adi-to-the-editor)
to manage your Wix site. If you use the Wix ADI editor, follow the steps
below. If you use the Wix Editor, jump to those steps instead.

### ADI Editor

Once you've [created](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/95-create-an-
embedded-form) your Privy form, include it in your ADI Wix content by
following these steps:

  * In Privy, navigate to the [Convert](https://dashboard.privy.com/campaigns) dashboard.
  * Locate and select the desired embedded form campaign and open the **Create** section.
  * Click the **Get Embedded Code** button on the _Embedded Form Design_ card.

  * Copy the ID shown next to the "data-campaign" tag in the HTML Code and incorporate it into the URL listed below. Make sure to replace the bolded campaign ID portion.

Copy the customized form permalink, as you'll need it in Wix momentarily.

  * In Wix, select **Site Actions** > **Edit Site** from your site's dashboard.

  * In the ADI Editor, navigate to the desired page and select **Add** > **Section to Page** from the toolbar. 
  * Select **HTML Embed** from the sidebar, add it to the page, and then move it to the desired location on the page. 
  * Select the **Settings** button next to the _HTML_ header in the sidebar to open the section HTML settings. 
  * Select the **Website** embed type and then paste the permalink into the form you created earlier in the **Paste it here...** field. 
  * Click somewhere else on the sidebar or page, and your Privy form should appear. Customize the rest of the section, such as removing any extra default text, to make sure the form is presented appropriately before ultimately previewing and publishing the changes.

# Troubleshooting

If you're encountering issues with your embedded forms on Wix, please attempt
the following:

### Disable reCAPTCHA

To disable the reCAPTCHA for your Privy forms:

  * Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your _Business Settings_. 
  * Scroll down and locate the _Invisible reCAPTCHA_ section. 
  * Disable the **Enable Invisible reCAPTCHA** checkbox. 
  * Click the **Save** button.

â€‹If this doesn't correct the issue, please contact support via
[email](mailto:support@privy.com) or chat.

**Note** : When reCAPTCHA is disabled via your account settings, Privy
effectively vouches for your registration process and will attempt to waive
all reCAPTCHA requirements. However, if behavioral analysis suspects that a
user may be a bot or that spam activities are taking place, reCAPTCHA can
still fire in the background. This aspect of reCAPTCHA cannot be disabled as
it is currently one of the best ways to protect Privy merchants from
suspicious or abusive activity.
