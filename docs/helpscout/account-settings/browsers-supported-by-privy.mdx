A supported web browser is required to utilize Privy's full set of features
properly. Some features might not behave as expected if you are using Privy on
an older or unsupported browser.

**Note:** These requirements apply to the use of the Privy platform and your
public-facing content. The browser and email client support for content
created in and hosted by Privy will vary depending on the HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript used in your emails or on your website.

# Windows-supported browsers

  * Google Chrome (latest version)
  * Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
  * Microsoft Edge (latest version)
  * Internet Explorer 11* 

* Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Edge as your default browser and supports Internet Explorer 11 as part of its backward compatibility efforts. Privy should continue to function correctly while this support continues; however, we cannot guarantee how Privy will perform in this particular browser. That said, Microsoft no longer [provides updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge) for earlier versions of Internet Explorer, and Privy does not support these. 

# Mac-supported browsers

  * Google Chrome (latest version)
  * Safari (latest version)
  * Mozilla Firefox (latest version)

# Update your web browsers

It's best to keep your browsers updated to the latest version. Not only does
this ensure that you can expect Privy to work as expected, but also ensures
that your web browsing experience is better overall. To update a supported
browser, please refer to their documentation:
