The Privy branding, including the Privy logo and the "Powered by Privy"
statement, is automatically removed from your displays when you upgrade to a
paid Starter Bundle. This branding cannot be removed or disabled for free
accounts.

To learn more, check out the [pricing page](https://www.privy.com/pricing) or
upgrade from the [Plans](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/plans) section
of your account.

**Note:** Adding a paid Privy Text plan does not remove this branding.
