A unique Privy code must be installed on your Shift4Shop website to display
your campaigns and track your website events (e.g., campaign views). If you're
using a different provider, please review the instructions outlined in [this
guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-your-site)
instead.

**Note:** These instructions may vary from theme to theme. If you need
additional assistance, please contact Shift4Shop Support.
