A unique Privy code must be installed on your Wix site in order to display
your onsite displays, track visitor behavior (e.g., display views), and
acquire information for segmentation or targeting. The Privy app for Wix
performs this installation automatically without the need for coding or
development skills.

If you're using a different provider, please review the instructions outlined
in [this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-
your-site) instead.

**Note:** The Privy app is only available for Wix sites on a [Premium
Plan](https://www.wix.com/upgrade/website) with a [connected
domain](https://support.wix.com/en/article/connecting-a-domain-to-the-wix-
name-servers). Additionally, your site must use the [Wix
Editor](https://support.wix.com/en/article/adi-moving-from-adi-to-the-editor)
and not the Wix ADI.

# Supported features

The extent of your possible Privy features depends on what information is
available in your Wix account. Additional contact and order information is
available to Privy if you use the Wix Store add-on. If this information is not
available in Wix, the app will only install the code required to display your
displays and capture/store the associated signup information in Privy.

# Installation steps

To install the Privy app for Wix:

  * Visit [Privy's listing](https://www.wix.com/app-market/privy-integration) in the Wix App Market. 
  * Click the **Add to Site** button. If you're not already logged into Wix, log in and select your site. 
  * Review the app's permissions and then select the **Add to Site** button. Log into Privy if you aren't already, and select the **Link** option next to your Privy account. This option is only available if the account isn't already connected to another site.

That's it! After linking an account and being redirected, your Privy code is
automatically installed on your site. Any applicable displays will start
appearing on your site immediately. The Privy app will also now be listed in
the [Manage Apps](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-
selector/?buttonText=Manage%20Apps&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D/manage-
installed-apps/) section of your Wix account.

# Troubleshooting

Encountered an issue during or after installation? Check out these common
fixes.

### Displays won't trigger.

Displays will not appear to visitors if your Wix site has a [cookie
banner](https://support.wix.com/en/article/displaying-a-cookie-banner-on-your-
site) active and the visitor has not provided their consent. For your displays
to display either:

  * Disable the cookie banner on your site via its [Privacy & Cookies](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Open%20Privacy%20Center&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/cookie-consent-settings-app?referralInfo=article_displaying-a-cookie-banner) settings.
  * Leave the cookie banner on and ensure the visitor provides consent. Once consent is provided, your displays will be able to appear on subsequent page loads. 

### Cross-sell displays won't integrate.

Privy does not offer catalog integration for Wix. This means that product IDs
need to be added manually when creating cross-sell displays.
