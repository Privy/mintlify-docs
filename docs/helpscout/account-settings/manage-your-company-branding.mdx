When you set up your account or rebrand your business, ensure that you update
your brand assets and settings in Privy. These default settings, such as your
preferred logo, colors, and font, make creating future content easier and
faster.

**Note:** Changes to these settings are not retroactive and will not affect
published or sent content.

# Update Your Logo

Setting a logo makes including it in your content much quicker. Once a logo is
selected, it is presented as the first option in your Photo Manager whenever
you opt to insert an image into your content. Additionally, the logo is
included in various email templates by default.

To configure your account's logo settings:

  * Select the **Account** dropdown menu at the top-right. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * Locate and click the **Add Logo** card under the _Business Information_ header. If you are updating an existing logo, the old logo will appear in this location instead. 
  * Select the logo from your photo library or upload an image from your device. Once you have selected the desired image, click the **Use This Photo** button. 
  * Scroll down and click the **Save Changes** button.

# Update Your Brand Colors

Privy applies your brand colors to buttons, text, links, and images by
default. However, you can override these defaults and customize the color of
these elements in each display or email. Check out the example below to review
where your brand colors appear in your content.

  * **Plays** \- Your brand colors are used in the default styling of newly created [Plays](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/181-should-i-use-a-play-or-build-my-own-display), such as the cart saver and welcome discount, making it easier and quicker to create, customize, and launch proven and popular displays. 

**Note:** Brand colors are not applied to [Build your
own](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/181-should-i-use-a-play-or-build-
my-own-display) displays.
