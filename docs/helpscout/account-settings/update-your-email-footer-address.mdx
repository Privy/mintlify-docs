To comply with anti-spam legislation like the United States [CAN-SPAM
Act](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-
guide-business) and Canada's [CASL](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-
topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-
electronic-documents-act-pipeda/r_o_p/canada-s-anti-spam-legislation/casl-
compliance-help-for-businesses/), marketing emails must include your
business's physical address and a link for contacts to manage their email
subscription. Privy will automatically add the proper unsubscribe link, but
you must update your address information before emailing.

**Note:** Be sure to review and follow any other marketing guidelines that
apply to your customers, as additional legislation may be in effect in
different countries and regions.
