# Change subscription

Privy currently offers a selection of plans and add-ons to address different
needs. They are:

  * **Trial** : The trial allows users to use Privy's Convert (list growth) and Email tools with limited restrictions for a 15-day period. 
  * **Conversion** : A conversion-only plan allows users to use Privy's Convert tool to grow their subscriber list, make on-site announcements, and increase sales via displays (e.g., popups). 
  * **Starter** : A Starter plan allows users to access the full functionality of Privy's Convert and Email products with pricing based on the account's mailable contacts. 
  * **Growth** : A Growth plan allows users to access the full functionality of Privy's Convert, Email, and Text products with pricing based on the account's mailable and textable contacts. 
  * **Text** : This add-on allows users of non-Growth plans to access the features of Privy Text with additional pricing based on the account's textable contacts. 

Each of these plans is managed separately.

## Upgrade or add a plan

To upgrade to the Starter or Growth plan or add a Text (SMS) plan:

  * Navigate to the [Explore Plans](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/plans) page in your Privy account. 
  * Select the appropriate **Upgrade** or **Buy** option next to the desired plan. 
  * On the subsequent screen, review your billing information and select **Confirm & Pay**. 

To upgrade from a trial to a Conversion-only plan, you must [speak to an
e-commerce coach](https://www.privy.com/talk-to-an-ecommerce-coach). Please
see Privy's [pricing page](https://www.privy.com/pricing) for more
information.

## Cancel a plan

To cancel an existing plan:

  * Navigate to the [My Plan & Billing](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/billing) page in your Privy account. 
  * Select the appropriate **Cancel** button next to the desired plan.

It is important to note that each of these plans must be managed separately
and are not automatically canceled if you uninstall the application. In
particular:

  * Downgrading one plan does not automatically cancel or downgrade your other plan(s).
  * Downgrading or canceling your connected e-commerce store (e.g., BigCommerce, Shopify, or Wix) does not automatically cancel your Privy plan(s).
  * Uninstalling or removing Privy from your store does not automatically cancel your plan(s).

If you choose to cancel all of your Privy products, your account will remain
active on a non-paid subscription, and its information will be maintained
unless the account is closed or deleted.

**Note:** If you cancel a plan, you will immediately lose access to the
associated paid features. For more information, see Privy's [terms of
service](https://privy.com/terms-and-conditions) and [refund
policy](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/54-billing-payments-refunds-
faq).

# Close account

To close your Privy account, navigate to your [Business
Information](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/business-info) page and
click the **Close Account** button. When closing an account, please note:

  * Closing an account is not reversible.
  * If you are on a paid plan when closing an account, Privy will attempt to cancel it automatically. 
  * You must close each account separately if your profile is attached to multiple businesses.

# Delete account

Privy has a process for honoring data subject requests related to various
compliance frameworks, including [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) and
[GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/). To request an account deletion in accordance with
these frameworks:

  * Start an email to [support@privy.com](mailto:support@privy.com). 
  * Provide your email address. It must be associated with a user in the Privy account. 
  * Use "Compliance - Data Removal Request" as the subject line. 
  * In the request's description, please provide:
    * The _Business Name_ and _Website URL_ are listed in your Privy account [here](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/business-info).
  * Select the **Submit** button. 

Following the submission, all of the account's identifiable information will
be scrubbed within 30 days. Once the information is removed, it cannot be
restored.

# Product & feature limits

The following limitations are imposed on the Privy product by default to
prevent abuse and ensure the highest level of stability for users:

**Limitation**| **Value**| **Details**  
---|---|---  
Active Displays|  100| Only 100 displays can be active at once.  
Custom Fields| 100 |  An account can only have 100 custom fields.  
Contacts|  1,000,000| An account can only have 1 million contacts.  
Newsletter Segments|  350,000| Newsletters can only be sent to 350K contacts
at a time.  
Product Menus|  100|  Only 100 products will be displayed in product dropdown
menus (e.g., cross-selling). If a product isn't available, product/Variant IDs
can be input manually.  
  
If one of these limits hinders your success with the Privy platform, please
contact your Customer Success Manager, or use the Billing Team's contact
information below.
