**Attention:** This integration is no longer supported.

To sync the contacts captured by your Privy Convert displays to your SendGrid
account, you must link (integrate) the two accounts and add automation rules
to your displays.

# Link the accounts

To link your Privy account with your SendGrid account:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the**Integrations** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * Scroll down to the _Available Integrations_ section and select the **SendGrid** option. 
  * Enter your credentials in the prompt and then select **Link Account**. To obtain your API key, log into SendGrid and follow [these instructions](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/#creating-an-api-key) to retrieve or create a _Full Access_ key.

All set! SendGrid should now appear as a linked account in the _Authorized
Accounts_ section. Time to add some automation rules.

# Add an automation rule

**Note:** These settings must be set for each display individually.

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to
SendGrid:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays**. 
  * Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Follow-up** step of the display builder. The selected display must include a form to sync contacts. 
  * Click the **Sync signups** button, select**SendGrid** from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**.

This display's signups will now sync to SendGrid. Click on the **Sync
signups** button again to sync contacts to additional services or lists. Check
