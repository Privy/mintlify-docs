## Privy's onsite displays and ADA compliance

The Department of Justice (DOJ) published the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) - Standards for Accessible Design in September 2010. These standards
state that all electronic and information technology must be accessible to
people with disabilities.

Privy strives to stay compliant and is making changes to become more ADA-
compliant to enable all who interact with Privy displays to navigate them
easily. The following Privy display types are considered dialogs or modals for
ADA compliance:

  * Popups
  * Flyouts
  * Banners
  * Spin-To-Win
  * Thank You Displays

**Note:** Bars, embedded forms, and landing pages are not considered dialogs
or modals.

Privy has empowered users to adhere to ADA compliance regulations for these
dialogs/modals by:

  * Site visitors can identify your Privy display as a separate modal, focus on the text in the display, and close the display.
  * Site visitors can use the tab button to navigate the display's elements (e.g., text, form fields, buttons).
  * Written context is given to identify and clarify the form fields (e.g., email, phone, text, etc.).
  * Site visitors can interact with or select answers to different forms or buttons/links (checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and links). 

Privy continues to strive for further compliance and will be continuing to
make improvements to become more compliant. If you have further questions
about this, please don't hesitate to contact the Privy team at
[research@privy.com](mailto:research@privy.com).

## Compliance tips for your designs

Users, including users with visual disabilities, must be able to perceive the
content you are showing. WCAG requires "at least 4.5:1" contrast, where
contrast measures the difference in perceived "luminance" or brightness
between two colors.

Below is an excerpt from [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/) (Web
Accessibility in Mind) that shows four examples with the minimum 4.5:1
contrast requirement for WCAG compliance. Privy recommends you meet or exceed
the following for contrast and color in your onsite displays and email
designs.

Here is a website to [help you determine the contrast
ratio](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure your text's
readability. These contrast requirements also apply to the text within a
graphic, called "images of text," the contrast and readability of text can
also be affected by the size, fonts, hover states, and more.
