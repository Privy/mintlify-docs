A unique Privy code must be installed on your WordPress.org website in order
to display your displays and track your website events (e.g., display views).
If you're using a different provider, please review the instructions outlined
in [this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-
your-site) instead.

# Install the code via a plugin

Follow the steps below to download and install the Privy plugin for WordPress.
If you need the code to load asynchronously, which means it will load last,
you will need to install the code manually. If you've already attempted the
installation, learn how to verify the installation.

  * Click [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/privy-production/assets/privy-wordpress-latest.zip) to download the WordPress Plugin and save it to your computer.
  * Upload the **privy-wordpress.zip** file to your WordPress site. To do this, navigate to the **Admin dashboard** in your WordPress site and select **Plugins** >**Add New** from the sidebar.

  * In Privy, click the **Account** dropdown menu from the navigation bar. Your business name appears on the menu. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section.

  * In WordPress, enter the account identifier into the Privy Website Widget settings and save. Access the page by navigating to the**Admin dashboard** > **Settings** _ > _**Privy Website Widget**. 

And that's it! Now, your site will display any display where the plugin/widget
is active.

# Install the code manually

Follow the steps below to copy and install your code. If you've already
attempted the installation, learn how to verify the installation.

  * In your Privy account, click the **Account** dropdown menu from the main navigation bar. Your business name appears on the menu. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section. 
  * Locate and select the **Default** or **Asynchronous** tab to reveal its details. The default code is the preferred method to install Privy, allowing it to load in line with everything else on your site. Meanwhile, the asynchronous code will load Privy last. 
  * Copy the selected code.

# Verify the installation

The Privy code allows you to display your displays and monitor your website's
events (e.g., display views). If your displays aren't displaying properly or
event information is missing, verify that the code has been installed and that

  * In your Privy account, click the **Account** dropdown menu from the main navigation bar. Your business name appears on the menu. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section. 
  * In the _Installation Guides_ section, locate and copy your account identifier. 
  * Open a page on your website and right-click anywhere on the page.
  * In the dropdown menu, select **View page source** or **View source**.
  * Use **CTRL-F** or **CMD-F** to search for the identifier that you copied.

  * If the code appears, verify that it has been copied and pasted correctly from your settings.

If the Privy code does not appear or is incorrect, follow the instructions

appears and has been copied and pasted correctly, verify that it's firing:

  * Open a page on your website and right-click anywhere on the page.
  * In the dropdown menu, select **Inspect Element** or**Inspect**. A toolbar will appear at the bottom or side of your screen.
  * Click the **Network** tab, then refresh your page. 
  * Click the **Name** column to sort the elements alphabetically, then look for widget _.js_. 
  * Next to _widget.js,_ you should see  _304 Not Modified_ or  _200 OK_ in the  _Status_ column.

may not be firing correctly. [Contact
