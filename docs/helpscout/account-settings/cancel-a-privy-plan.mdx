It is important to note that these plans must be managed separately and are
not automatically canceled if you uninstall the application. In particular:

  * Downgrading one plan does not automatically cancel or downgrade your other plan(s).
  * Downgrading or canceling your connected e-commerce store (e.g., BigCommerce, Shopify, or Wix) does not automatically cancel your Privy plan(s).
  * Uninstalling or removing Privy from your store does not automatically cancel your plan(s).

If you cancel all of your Privy products, your account will remain active on a
non-paid subscription, and its information will be maintained unless the
account is [closed](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/56-account-
management-faq) or
[deleted](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/56-account-management-faq).
