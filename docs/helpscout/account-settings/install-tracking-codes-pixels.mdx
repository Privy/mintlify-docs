Privy supports a wide range of third-party tracking codes and pixels,
including those from Google Analytics, Google Adwords, and Facebook Ads. These
snippets from external tools work similarly to the Privy code. Once installed
on your site, the tracking code or pixel detects site visits. This data
becomes the basis for better understanding and addressing your customer
behaviors.

**Note:** Following the steps outlined below makes a manual Google Analytics
install possible. However, for most users, using the [Privy integration
](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/96-how-to-enable-google-analytics)is
recommended.

# Install your snippet

To install your third-party tracking code or pixel:

  * Select the **Account** option from the navigation bar. Your business name appears here. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Customizations** under the  _Business Settings_ section.
  * Paste your snippet into the appropriate field. A snippet placed in the _Tracking Pixels_ section runs on all pages where a display is shown, while a snippet placed in the _Conversion Pixels_ section runs on all pages where a user signs up for a display.
  * Once youâ€™ve added your snippet, select the **Save Changes** option at the bottom of the page.

# Customize your snippets

Personalization variables can be added to your snippets by selecting the **Add
personalization variable** dropdown menu. These variables allow you to send
additional data to compatible systems by populating the variable with the
related information when the code or pixel fires.

Customization of third-party codes and pixels is only recommended for advanced
users. Changes to these snippets can easily prevent them from functioning
correctly. The personalization variables use the open-source [Liquid template
language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

**Warning** : Contact data referenced in custom conversion JavaScript (JS) via
variables is only available when collected (e.g., Form submission). Data
collected from prior signups or imports will not be available. Additionally,
variables are not supported for tracking JS snippets.
