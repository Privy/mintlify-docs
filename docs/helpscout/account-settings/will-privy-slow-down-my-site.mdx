Most users do not see a noticeable impact on their site performance when Privy
is installed. This is because Privy aims to remain as lightweight as possible
regardless of your installation method. That said, Privy offers both
synchronous and asynchronous code options to provide the best compatibility
with your site, and these code formats impact site performance differently.

# Optimization and hosting

The Privy engineering team is constantly working to optimize the load times
and file sizes associated with the widget used to display your Privy displays.
Additionally, each iteration of the widget references assets in a world-class
content delivery network (CDN) with an average response time of under 10
milliseconds. To learn more about the benefits of a CDN, click

# Installation method

**Synchronous code** \- This is the recommended option for a manual install of
Privy. Synchronous code is executed in sequence wherein each statement waits
for the previous statement to finish before executing. This code format allows
the installer to determine the relative order of code execution on their site,
which means Privy could load faster or slower based on the site's
configuration.

**Asynchronous code** \- This is the default option when Privy is installed on
your site via an integration such as Shopify or Wix. This code format yields
to your site, loading as passively as possible, always giving your site
precedence. It does not block any content or scripts on your page from
loading. This means Privyâ€™s assets are not placed on the critical render path
for your site. While web page analysis tools may show that Privy loads later
than other resources, this is entirely intentional.

# Evaluating Privy's impact

**Note:** Familiarity with Google Chrome's developer tools is recommended.

To review and better understand Privy's impact on your site performance:

  * Using Google Chrome, navigate to a site page that includes the Privy code. 
  * Open the browser's DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+J (PC) or Command+Option+J (Mac). 
  * Switch to the **Network** tab and then reload the page. 
  * As the page loads, the tab will populate with information. Each row represents a resource. By default, the resources are listed chronologically. 
  * Locate the**Widget.JS** resource to review its information. The most relevant information concerning performance is Status (Did the widget load properly with a 200 OK?), Time (How long did the widget take to load?), and Waterfall placement (When did it load? Did it allow other more important resources to take precedence?). 

In the example below, the widget is loaded asynchronously. The site's content
is given priority over the Privy widget and the page's associated display.
