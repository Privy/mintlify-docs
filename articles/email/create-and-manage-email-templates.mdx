Consistency in branding and presentation enables customers to feel familiar
with your content and is essential for building trust. It quickly reassures
them that the communication is genuine and establishes expectations on how
they can find the information that matters to them.

Templates make this consistency easier to manage. They allow you to save the
structure and design of an email so that it can be reused and personalized
additional times. If you aren't sure where to begin, a handful of existing
templates are available in the email builder.

# Create a template

To create a new email template:

  * Locate or create any email that you would like to turn into a template and access the email designer by clicking on the **Edit design** button. 
  * Use the [drag and drop editor](https://help.privy.com/article/450-use-the-drag-and-drop-email-editor) to create the desired email. If you're looking for some inspiration, check out [these design resources](https://www.privy.com/customer-examples) or try customizing an existing Privy template. 
  * In the upper right, select the **Templates** dropdown menu and click **Save email as template**. 
  * Provide a name that makes the template easy to identify, and then click **Save & Create**.

Your new email template will now appear in the templates gallery and will be
accessible the next time you need to create an email with the same general
layout and design.

# Use a template

To use an existing email template:

  * Navigate to the Campaigns page and select New Email or the Automations page, select New Automation and then choose the automation type. 
  * In the upper right, select the **Templates** dropdown menu and click **Choose a template**. 
  * Use the tabs, dropdown menu, and search bar to locate the desired template. Hover over a template and select the **Preview**() button to preview your content before making a selection. 
  * Select the template you'd like to use and click the **Save** option at the top right. The selected template will now be applied to the email's existing content and can be customized. 

**Note:** Selecting a template will overwrite an email's existing design and
content, so making a selection as soon as possible is recommended. Please make
sure to back up the content you'd like to reuse if you've decided to switch
the template after customizing the email.
