The Product block allows you to quickly access and incorporate products from
your Shopify catalog into your email newsletters. Simply drag the block into
your content, select the product, and customize the block's title, image, and
layout.

**Note:** This functionality is only available for accounts integrated with
**Shopify** at this time.

# Insert the Product block

To insert a Product block into a newsletter:

  * Navigate to **Campaigns**.
  * Select or [create the newsletter](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/169-send-newsletter-emails) you'd like to include the product information. 
  * Select Edit Design to enter the drag-and-drop editor. If you create a new email after selecting a template, you'll be immediately placed in the editor. 
  * Drag and drop the **Product** block from the _sidebar 's Content _section to the desired location in your newsletter. 
  * Search for and select the product you'd like to feature in the prompt. The drop-down menu does not display all of your products. If a product doesn't appear in the menu, use the search function to find specific items by name or Product ID. Once an item is selected, hit **Save**. 

A Product block is now part of your newsletter. Repeat the process to include
multiple products in a single newsletter. Products can be displayed full-width
or in columns.

# Customize the Product block

The Product block auto-populates with the selected product's title and primary
image by default. The entire image and title area will direct the recipient to
the associated product page in a new tab when clicked. To update or override
these default settings:

  * Select the **Product** block that you placed in your newsletter. 
  * Customize the block's options, including the selected product, the title/description, the on-click behavior, and other design elements in the sidebar.
