All Privy emails include an unsubscribe link in the email footer for contacts
to opt out of your email communications. This unsubscribe link can also be
placed directly in the body of your email with a merge tag. Incorporating the
link directly into the body content is particularly useful if you'd like to
call more attention to the option as it can be customized while the default
footer link cannot. Some situations in which you might want to call more
attention to the unsubscribe link include:

# Audience Maintenance

Unengaged subscribers are a major concern for proper list management as they
can hurt your sending reputation over time. Unengaged subscribers are those
contacts who have a valid email address, are still subscribed to your list,
but haven’t opened and/or clicked one of your emails for quite a while (e.g.,
6-12 months). While they haven’t put in the effort to manually unsubscribe,
they’ve been mentally or emotionally unsubscribed and are simply ignoring or
deleting your emails. The longer they remain unengaged, the greater the
likelihood that future emails will end up in the junk folder or spam filter.

To avoid this situation, a routine re-engagement campaign is recommended. Send
your unengaged subscribers a targeted email acknowledging that they haven’t
opened or clicked any messages in a while, and simply ask if they want to
continue to receive your emails.

# Facilitate Opt-Out Requests

It’s crucial that you make unsubscribing to your emails as easy for your
contacts as subscribing was in the first place. Never attempt to hide the
unsubscribe link from a subscriber and if they'd like to unsubscribe
themselves instead of having you [facilitate it on their
behalf](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/139-understand-
deliverability), make the option obvious.

# Style the link

To style the unsubscribe link in your email:

  * Locate and select the desired email to access its details.
  * Select the **Edit design** to access the email editor.
  * Click into a content element and configure the link or button URL to point to the **{{ business.unsubscribe_link }}** merge tag. If the link is in a text element, simply select the **Unsubscribe Link** option from the toolbar's **Merge Tag** dropdown menu. 
  * Once the merge tag is added, style the unsubscribe link as you normally would with any other link or button, and then **Save** your changes.

A custom unsubscribe link is now included in the body of your email. If a
recipient clicks the link, they will be opted out and will not receive future
emails sent from your Privy account. This action will not unsubscribe the
contact from any other email service providers that you may also be using.

**Note:** When the email is sent, Privy will detect the custom unsubscribe
variable and will remove the default unsubscribe link from the footer.
Marketing emails must include an unsubscribe option to comply with various
compliance frameworks, including [CAN-
SPAM](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-
proceedings/can-spam-rule).
