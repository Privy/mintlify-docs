A contact's email and text permissions determine whether or not they are
reachable. Each status is ultimately determined by the contact's previous
interactions with your brand. A contact's current permissions are available
for review on the [Contacts](https://dashboard.privy-staging.com/contacts)
dashboard and their profile.

**Note:** A contact must have an email address or phone number associated with
their profile for an email or text permission to appear. A contact can have
one without the other.

# Email messages

There are currently four possible email permissions:

  * **Mailable** : The contact is eligible to receive emails. A contact typically becomes mailable by submitting a form with the proper [consent](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/206-understand-marketing-consent) or by being included in an [import](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/50-create-and-manage-contacts) designated for subscribed contacts. 
  * **Unsubscribed** : The contact is not eligible to receive emails. A contact becomes unsubscribed by opting out via the email preferences link in your emails or by being included in an [import](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/50-create-and-manage-contacts) designated for unsubscribed contacts. 
  * **Suppressed** : The contact is not eligible to receive emails because their email address is invalid or Privy had trouble getting the server to accept the email (e.g., Hard Bounce). 
  * **Unset** : The contact has neither opted in nor opted out of receiving emails but will not be mailable until they have opted in. A contact typically becomes unset if they completed a purchase without also opting into marketing communications or were included in an import that is pending review by Privy's compliance team. Any newly imported contacts will remain in an unset status until approved. 

## Managing email permissions

**Resubscribing a contact** \- Unsubscribed contacts will be resubscribed when
a signup event provides
[consent](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/206-understand-marketing-
consent). Suppressed contacts will not be resubscribed, as that is currently
treated as a permanent state. If you believe a contact has been incorrectly
marked as suppressed, please [contact the support
team](mailto:support@privy.com).

**Note:** If the information of a previously deleted contact is used during a
signup event, the contact's initial email permissions will reflect their most
recent permissions prior to their deletion.

**Unsubscribing a contact** \- Contacts can unsubscribe themselves by clicking
the email preferences link at the bottom of any email received from Privy.

Additionally, if a contact requests a removal, you can manually unsubscribe a
contact by clicking the **Unsubscribe** button on their profile.

## Sharing permissions information

**Syncing mailable and unset contacts -** When syncing a signup event to an
external email service provider (ESP), Privy will send a marketing flag when
possible. The provider can then use the information to update
[consent](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/206-understand-marketing-
consent) and reachability information on their end.

**Scenario**| **Email Flag**  
---|---  
A subscription without an opt-in checkbox is submitted.| Accepts marketing  
A subscription with an opt-in checkbox is submitted with the box checked. | Accepts marketing  
A subscription with an opt-in checkbox is submitted without the box checked. |  Does not accept marketing  
  
If the contact's subscription status at the partner was "unsubscribed" when
Privy sent the information, the sync might resubscribe the contact on the
partner's end as well. Additionally, this sync may result in the recreation of
a previously deleted contact. However, both of these behaviors depend on the
specifics of the partner's API.

**Syncing unsubscribed and suppressed contacts** \- Privy does not currently
support real-time syncing of this information to or from partner email service
providers (ESPs).

# Text messages

There are currently two possible text permissions:

  * **Textable** : The contact is eligible to receive texts. A contact becomes textable by submitting a form with the text opt-in checkbox checked and then answering "YES" to the double opt-in message sent to their number. This action provides [explicit consent](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/206-understand-marketing-consent). 
  * **Not Textable** : The contact is not eligible to receive texts. 

## Managing text permissions

**Unsubscribe a contact** \- Contacts can unsubscribe themselves by replying
STOP. This disclaimer is included in all Privy texts automatically.

**Resubscribe a contact** \- Unsubscribed contacts can resubscribe themselves
by submitting a display that provides new explicit consent.
