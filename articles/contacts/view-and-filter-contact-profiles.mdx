The information collected about your contacts is stored in their contact
profiles. These profiles are viewable and filterable based on various [contact
attributes](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/201-overview-of-contact-
attributes), [detected
attributes](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/118-overview-of-form-
fields), and [tags](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/146-add-privy-
tags-to-your-contacts). These filters allow you to quickly identify segments
of your audience for additional review or export.

  * Apply the desired filter(s) via the sidebar menu and select the **Filter** button. Any contacts that meet the specified criteria will appear on the dashboard. The number of contacts that meet the criteria will appear at the top of the table and in the _With X contacts_ dropdown menu.
