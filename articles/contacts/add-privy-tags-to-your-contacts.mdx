Privy Tags are labels that you create to organize your contacts. Tagging
enables you to create a custom contact structure in Privy by differentiating
contacts based on the data you know about them. Privy Tags are highly
customizable and can be applied during an import or via a contact's profile.
Once a Privy Tag is applied, it becomes available for contact filtering and
audience segmentation.

Privy Tags are often used to identify a contact's source, such as the name of
a specific in-person event or the contact's relationship with your business,
such as Friends & Family or VIP.

# Add tags during an import

When you [import a
spreadsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/privy.com/support/example_privy_import.csv)
(CSV) of contacts, you will reach a **Tags** step. This step in the import
process allows you to apply new or existing tags to all of the contacts
included in the import file.
