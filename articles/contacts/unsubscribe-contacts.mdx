Unsubscribing is removing an email address from a mailing list so that it does
not receive any further contacts. Every email campaign on Privy includes an
unsubscribe link, allowing subscribers to opt-out at any moment. These links
are critical for your marketing strategy because they prevent you from sending
emails to individuals who no longer wish to receive them. Having a list with a
genuinely interested audience along with good[ list
hygiene](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/13-list-hygiene-clean-your-
email-list) enhances deliverability and boosts your[ email
performance](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/120-understand-email-
engagement). Unsubscribes can also be done by you, following the steps below.

# Individual unsubscribe

To individually unsubscribe a contact:

  * In your Privy account, select **Contacts** on the main navigation.
  * On the _Contacts_ dashboard, click on the contact you wish to unsubscribe.
  * Next, select **Unsubscribe** and confirm the unsubscription by clicking the **Unsubscribe** button.

After unsubscribing a contact, you can add
[tags](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/146-add-privy-tags-to-your-
contacts) to make filtering or segmenting for this specific contact easier in
the future. Please note that tags are optional. To individually apply tags to
your contacts:

  * On the _Attributes_ card, click **\+ Add a tag**.
  * Select an available tag or create a new one by adding the tag to the appropriate field.
  * Click **Save**.

# Bulk unsubscribe

Bulk unsubscribing contacts in Privy are made via a CSV file containing the
contact's information. To correctly import these files, you must have your
data structured appropriately. A sample file is available for download
[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/privy.com/support/example_privy_import.csv).
Please make sure your import meets the following criteria:

  * The file must use the CSV format. 
  * The file must include an email address column.
  * The first row of the file must contain column headers. These headers are not case-sensitive and are used to match the imported values with customer attributes (fields) in Privy. 
  * Your file should contain exclusively Non-mailable (unsubscribed) contacts. 

Once you're ready to go, do the following:

  * In your Privy account, select **Contacts** from the main navigation.
  * On the _Contacts_ dashboard, select the **Add Contacts** option.
  * Select the **CSV Upload** option from the dropdown menu.
  * Click **Choose File** to locate the CSV file on your computer. Once you have selected the file, click **Next** in the lower right corner.

  * On the  _Match your columns_ page, you will match the file's column headers with customer attributes (fields) in Privy. Use the dropdown menus to select an existing attribute or click **Create New Field** to create a new custom field to store the information. After matching all of the fields and identifying one of them as the required email field, click **Next**.

  * On the _Tag_ page, you can apply [a tag](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/146-add-privy-tags-to-your-contacts) to every contact in the file to make filtering or segmenting for them more straightforward in the future. Select one or more tags from the dropdown menu (or create a new one) and click **Next**.
  * Lastly, review and confirm your file upload by clicking **Submit**.

After submitting the import, Privy's Compliance Team will review it. Please
keep in mind that depending on the size of the import file, this procedure can
take a while. The review status of the import is available in the  _Import_
section of your account's [Business
Settings](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/imports).
