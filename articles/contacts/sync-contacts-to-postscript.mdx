To sync the contacts captured by your Privy Convert displays to your
Postscript account, you must link (integrate) the two accounts and add
automation rules to your compatible displays.

# Link the accounts

To link your Privy account with your Postscript account:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the**Integrations** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * Scroll down to the _Available Integrations_ section and select the **Postscript** option. 
  * Enter your email address and API Token in the prompt and then select **Link Account**.

All set! Postscript should now appear as a linked account in the _Authorized
Accounts_ section. Time to ensure that your display includes the proper fields
and disclaimer information.

# Create a compatible display

For the proper information to sync to Postscript so that you can send contacts
text messages, a display must include the **phone** field and a consent
disclaimer with the following language:

"I agree to receive recurring automated marketing text messages (e.g., cart
reminders) at the phone number provided. Consent is not a condition to
purchase. Msg & data rates may apply. Msg frequency varies. Reply HELP for
help and STOP to cancel. View our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy."

Please link the "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" components to your
versions of those documents. Information on updating your documents with the
proper language for an SMS marketing program is available from Postscripts in
these "Help" articles:

  * [Update Your Terms of Service](https://help.postscript.io/hc/en-us/articles/1260804633430-Update-Your-Terms-of-Service) & [Update Your Privacy Policy](https://help.postscript.io/hc/en-us/articles/1260804685709-Update-Your-Privacy-Policy)

The complete display should look something like this:

With the proper fields and disclaimer included in your display, it's time to
add an automation rule to sync the collected contacts from Privy to your
Postscript account.

# Add an automation rule

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to
Postscript:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays**. 
  * Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Follow-up** step of the display builder. As outlined in the previous section of this guide, the selected display must include a form with the phone field and the appropriate consent disclaimer. 
  * Click the **Sync signups** button, select**Postscript** from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**. 

  

This display's signups will now sync to the selected keyword automated flow in
Postscript. Click on the **Sync signups** button again to sync contacts to
additional services or lists. Check out [this
guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/108-use-display-automation-
rules) for more information on automation rules and how to troubleshoot common
sync issues.

**Note:** These settings must be set for each display individually.
