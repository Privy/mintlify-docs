Export your contacts to a CSV file or directly to one of your linked accounts.
Exports contain personally identifiable information (e.g., Email and Name),
basic analytics (e.g., Sessions and Pageviews), tags, and custom properties
with names under 64 characters. All of this information is clearly labeled in
the export's header row.

# Export contacts to CSV

To export contacts in your account to a CSV:

  * Navigate to **Contacts** via the main navigation. 
  * If you want to export a specific segment of customers, select the desired filters from the sidebar and click the **Filter** button. If none are selected, the export contains all contacts. 
  * Select the **Export () contacts** dropdown menu. The number listed is the expected export size. 
  * Select **Download CSV** from the dropdown menu's options. 
  * Confirm your decision by selecting the **Email CSV** button in the prompt. 

When the export is ready, an email containing a download link will be sent to
the email address associated with your Privy login. To review this address,
select **My Information** from the _Account_ menu at the top right.

  * Click the **Download File** button in the email. 

The file will download and will be available for review or use elsewhere.

# Troubleshoot export issues

**No export email received** \- File preparation can take multiple minutes,
especially if your export contains many contacts. That said, if you are still
encountering issues receiving or accessing your exported CSVs via email,
navigate to the [Exports](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/exports)
section of your account's _Business Settings_ and initiate the download from
there.
