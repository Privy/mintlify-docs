Privy integrates with many of the industry's leading email service providers
(ESPs). If you're working with one already, you can link your accounts to sync
new Privy contacts to your existing service automatically. If Privy doesn't
integrate with your current service, you can manually [export your Privy
contacts](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/159-how-to-export-your-
contacts) as a CSV file and import them directly into the external provider.

# Integrate with your email provider

To link your Privy account with a supported email service provider:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the**Integrations** option from the dropdown menu.
  * Scroll down to the  _Available Integrations_ section and select your provider.
  * Follow the prompts. Each provider is a bit different. Most of the time, all you need is your username and password for the selected service; however, some providers require additional pieces of information.

All set! The selected provider should appear as a linked account in the
_Authorized Accounts_ section. Now, it's time to add some automation rules to
sync your contacts.

# Add an Automation Rule

## To a Template Display

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to
your provider:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**. 
  * Select the template display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. The selected display must include a form to sync contacts. 
  * Click the Show Advanced Settings button, scroll to the _Sync Integrations_ section, and click on it.
  * Select the account and list that you would like to sync to and save

## To a Classic Display

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to
your provider:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**. 
  * Select the display you'd like to sync and navigate to the **Follow-up** step of the display builder. The selected display must include a form to sync contacts. 
  * Click the **Sync signups** button, select the provider from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**. 

  

This display's signups will now sync to the selected provider. Click on the
**Sync signups** button again to sync contacts to additional services or
lists. Check out [this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/108-use-
display-automation-rules) for more information on automation rules and how to
troubleshoot common sync issues. If your displays include custom fields,
please make sure they are [mapped
correctly](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/123-create-and-use-field-
mapping) between Privy and the external provider.

**Note:** These settings must be set individually for each display.
