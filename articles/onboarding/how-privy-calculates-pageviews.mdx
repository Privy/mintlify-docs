At Privy, the pricing for Privy Conversion is based on the average pageviews
your site gets.

# What is a pageview?

A pageview is an instance of a page being loaded in a browser. A Privy
pageview is registered each time a page containing your Privy code is loaded
on your site.

# How's my average calculated?

Privy reviews up to three months of historical website pageviews starting at
the point of purchase. Depending on how long Privy has been installed on your
site, this look-back period could be as short as one day or as long as three
months. If there's not enough data, the tool will calculate the average
pageviews for every day that had data available, then multiply by 30.

Every three months after your initial review, the tool will automatically look
at your average monthly pageviews across those months and adjust your price
tier up or down.

# Can I review my current average?

Yes. After you sign up for Privy, it takes 2-3 days to determine your average
monthly pageviews. Once the figure has been calculated, you can view it by
navigating to your [My Plan &
Billing](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/billing) page.
