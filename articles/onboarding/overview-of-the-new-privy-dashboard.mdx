Privy’s Dashboard provides you with digestible, relevant insights to gauge
engagement and performance across Displays, Campaigns, and Automations, as
well as deliverability metrics for Email. The Dashboard is commonly used to
answer questions such as:

  * What was my Attributed Revenue across Campaigns and Automations this quarter compared to last quarter? What about all Emails vs. SMS? 
  * Are my Automations or Campaigns driving an increase in orders this month? Is it because more messages were sent, or is my order rate higher?
  * Which Campaigns drove the most revenue this month? And which ones had the highest engagement? 
  * How much revenue did my Email and SMS Marketing contribute during Black Friday / Cyber Monday this year, compared to last year? 
  * What do my email deliverability rates look like this month? Is there anything that needs attention?
  * Which Displays are driving the most sign-ups over the past 90 days?

At the top of the Dashboard, you can select the Reporting period to access
data from [May 2022 onwards] and a comparison period. The Comparison period
can be the prior period or the prior year. If you choose the prior period, the
comparison period will automatically select the appropriate dates. The
Reporting period applies the date filter to all data within the Dashboard.

The Dashboard has 6 Performance Cards. Read below to learn how we define each
metric. Each Card provides data for the chosen Reporting period and, if
available, a comparison period.

**Note** : The reporting period for attributed revenue and orders considers
when an order is placed, not when the marketing message is delivered.
Therefore, orders placed during the reporting period will be included in the
report, even if the marketing message was sent outside the reporting window.

## Revenue

This card offers the following information:

  * Attributed Revenue: The total amount of revenue collected from contacts who engaged (opened or clicked) with a delivered message within 7 days, according to Privy’s attribution model. 
  * Orders: The total number of orders from contacts who engaged (opened or clicked) with a delivered message within 7 days.
  * Order Value: The average order value for orders placed during the Reporting period. 
  * Order Rate: The percentage of successfully delivered messages that result in a placed order. This rate measures unique orders, not total. For example, an order rate of 0.50% means that on average, every 1,000 delivered messages results in 5 recipients placing an order.

This card offers the following information:

collection capabilities, such as a Free Shipping Bar if those are active
during the Reporting period.

## Emails

iAh1EC6v3u.jpg)

This card offers the following information:

  * Total Sent: The total number of emails sent during the reporting period.
  * Delivered: The percentage of successfully delivered emails compared to the total number sent. 
  * Bounced: The percentage of emails that resulted in a soft or hard bounce compared to the total number of emails sent. [Learn more about Hard vs. Soft Bounces](https://help.privy.com/article/550-hard-vs-soft-bounces). 
  * Open Rate: The total number of unique opens divided by the total number of delivered emails. 
  * Click Rate: The total number of unique clicks divided by the total number of delivered emails. 
  * Order Rate: The total number of unique orders divided by the total number of delivered emails. 
  * Unsubscribed: The percentage of contacts who unsubscribed from the contact list after receiving an email. 
  * Spam Rate: An acceptable spam rate for emails is typically below 0.1%. A spam rate exceeding 0.1% may impact your email deliverability and inbox placement. A rate exceeding 0.3% will have a noticeable impact on email deliverability. Maintaining a low spam rate is crucial to ensuring your emails are delivered to recipients' inboxes and to protecting your sender's reputation with email service providers. Learn more about [List Hygiene](https://help.privy.com/article/478-list-hygiene-clean-your-email-list). 

**Note:** Rate calculations include all events that occurred within the
selected period. For instance, the open rate for a given period is determined
by dividing the total number of emails opened by the total number of emails
delivered. Because many recipients do not open emails on the same day they
receive them, rates may appear skewed over shorter periods but tend to even
out over longer ones.

## SMS

This card offers the following information:

  * Total Sent: The total number of SMS messages sent during the reporting period.
  * Click Rate: The total number of unique clicks divided by the total number of delivered SMS messages. 
  * Order Rate: The percentage of successfully delivered SMS messages that result in a placed order. This rate measures unique orders, not total. For example, an order rate of 0.50% means that on average, every 1,000 delivered SMS messages results in 5 recipients placing an order.
