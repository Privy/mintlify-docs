# Manual install

Follow the steps below to install your Privy code.

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section. 
  * Locate and select the **Default** or **Asynchronous** tab to reveal its details. The default code is the preferred method to install Privy and will allow it to load in line with everything else on your site. Meanwhile, the asynchronous code will load Privy last. 
  * Copy the selected code and include the snippet on each page you'd like to show a display or track events. Place it before the closing `</head>` tag whenever possible.

# Verify the installation

The Privy code allows you to show your displays to visitors and monitor your
website's events (e.g., display views). If your displays aren't triggering
properly or event information is missing, verify that the code is installed
and firing correctly:

  * Select the **Account** option from the navigation bar in Privy. Your business name appears here. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section. 
  * In the _Installation Guides_ section, locate and copy your account identifier. 
  * Open a page on your website and right-click anywhere on the page.
  * In the dropdown menu, select **View page source** or **View source**.
  * Use **CTRL-F** or **CMD-F** to search for the identifier that you copied.

  * If the code appears, verify that it has been copied and pasted correctly from your settings.

may not be firing correctly. [Contact Support](mailto:support@privy.com) for
