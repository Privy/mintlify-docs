Privy currently offers integrations with many of the top e-commerce platforms,
email service providers (ESPs), text (SMS) platforms, and customer rewards
programs. These integrations offer quick and easy information sharing between
Privy and your other favorite tools.

**Important Update:** As of December 1, 2022, Privy began discontinuing
support for a selection of previously available integrations. You can learn

# Remove an integration

**Note:** If you [manually installed Privy on your
site](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-your-site),
such as those managed via
[HubSpot](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/105-install-privy-on-
hubspot) or [Squarespace](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/36-install-
privy-on-squarespace), to use Privy displays (e.g., popups and banners), you
must remove the Privy code from your website's HTML. This is not considered an
integration.

To remove an integration that is not with an e-commerce platform:

  * In Privy, navigate to the [Integrations > Linked Accounts](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts) section of your account settings. 
  * Locate the integration and select the **Delete**() option.

ecommerce_integration.png)

To remove an integration with an e-commerce platform:

  * Login to the e-commerce platform. 
  * Navigate to the platform's app settings, directory, or marketplace. Each provider's process is documented in their help center - [BigCommerce](https://support.bigcommerce.com/), [Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/app/help), and [Wix](https://support.wix.com/). 
  * Select the delete, remove, or uninstall option.

If another service is providing or promoting a Privy integration, please
ensure it is also listed here in the
[Knowledgebase](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/) or on the [Privy
website](https://www.privy.com/integrations). If it isn't, the integration
does not fall within the scope of Privy's support team and may break or cause
disruptions at any time.
