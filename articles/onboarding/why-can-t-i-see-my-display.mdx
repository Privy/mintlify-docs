​​​​​​​To help you create an excellent customer experience, Privy uses cookies
to track how your visitors interact with your displays. If Privy detects that
a visitor has already submitted information to a display, it will not be shown
to them again. If Privy detects that a visitor has already seen and dismissed
a display, it will not be shown to them until the next day by default. These
behaviors help ensure visitors aren't bombarded with displays while visiting
your site.

**How does this affect you?** In almost all instances, it means that if you've
already seen or submitted your display while navigating around your website or
during testing, you will need to take specific actions to see it again. These
actions are outlined in more detail below.

# Troubleshooting options

Unable to see your display? Please try the following options:

## Private Browsing

When testing your display, test it in a different browser from the one you
typically use to view your website - almost all browsers have a setting that
is commonly referred to as either private browsing or incognito mode. Viewing
your site through this mode lets you see it as if you're a first-time visitor.
Not sure how to access this setting? No problem. Here are a few links that
provide you with steps on how to enable this setting in common browsers:

  * [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en&__hstc=20629287.c1ffb9eee722387561972ebc9ec07e17.1583245382856.1590098325284.1590180118068.41&__hssc=20629287.1.1590180118068&__hsfp=2642571461)
  * [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version)
  * [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416)
  * [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge)

**Note:** This option allows you to trigger the display regardless of previous
submissions, views, or dismissals and is the preferred troubleshooting option.

## Display Triggers

You can control how often a display appears to visitors via its settings.
Configuring a display to appear more frequently or always will often reveal a
missing display.

  * Select Convert > All displays from the main navigation in your Privy account. 
  * Select the display you'd like to edit from the dashboard. 
  * Select the **Settings** step from the display builder.
  * Select the **When To Show** option from the _Targeting Rules_ section, update the **Trigger automatically at most** settings to **No limit** , and **Save**.

With the "trigger at most" setting set to **No limit** , your display will
continue to display for you.

**Note:** This option only allows you to trigger the display if you have not
already submitted it.
