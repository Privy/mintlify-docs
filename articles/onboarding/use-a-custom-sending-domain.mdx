The default address used to send emails from your account is a shared Privy
address. However, to [improve your email
deliverability](https://www.privy.com/blog/how-to-improve-email-
deliverability) and build trust with your email recipients, this address
should be updated to reflect your specific domain and brand. If your DNS
provider is [Domain.com](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/231-use-a-
domain-com-sending-domain),
[GoDaddy](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/151-use-a-godaddy-sending-
domain), [NameCheap](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/41-use-a-
namecheap-sending-domain),
[Shopify](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/228-use-a-shopify-sending-
domain), or [Wix](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/77-use-a-wix-
sending-domain), please follow their platform-specific instructions instead.

â€‹Please ensure that you meet the following requirements before proceeding:

  * You must own a domain name - addresses from free providers like Gmail or Yahoo won't work.
  * You must have the ability to update the DNS records of your domain.
  * You must be hosting a website at the root of the domain. 

**Note:** The approach to updating DNS records varies from one provider to
another. If you encounter issues locating these settings, please contact the
provider directly.

# Add the domain

To add a new sending domain:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the**Business Information** option from the dropdown menu.
  * In the sidebar, select **Sending Domain** under the  _Email Settings_ section. 
  * Click the **\+ Add Sending Domain** button in the upper right. 
  * In the prompt, enter your domain name (e.g., example.com) and click the **Save** button. The provided domain must be a root domain, not a subdomain (e.g., mail.example.com).

# Update your DNS information

After completing the previous steps, DNS records are generated for your
domain. The records are automatically presented to you after saving the domain
for the first time. However, if you have navigated away from the page, you can
easily access the records by returning to your [Sending
Domain](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/sending-domains) settings,
locating the domain, and clicking the **DNS Records** button.

Once you've accessed the records:

  * Add each of them to your DNS provider. There is a mix of CNAME and TXT records.
  * Once all of the records are added, return to the records in Privy and click the **Verify and Set Default** button next to the domain. This action will check if the DNS records were updated correctly and set the domain as the default for your emails going forward. 

**Note:** It can take up to 48 hours for the DNS records to propagate and
properly verify.

# Send emails with the domain

After verifying your sending domain, you can update the default "from" address
for emails sent from your account. If you don't update these settings, emails
will be sent using "offers" as the username paired with your custom sending
domain. To update this setting:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the**Business Information** option from the dropdown menu.
  * In the sidebar, select **Sender Options** under the  _Email Settings_ section.
  * Input the desired address before the "@" symbol in the 

 _Default From Email_ field.

  * Ensure the desired custom domain appears to the right of the "@" symbol.
  * Click the **Save Changes** button to confirm your selections. 

Completion of this process will update all emails that you create moving
forward. Check out this example from our Space Age Trading Cards friends, who
combined "launches" with their custom sending domain to create their default
From Email address.

To update this setting for emails set up before the change:

  * Go into the email editor and click on the **From** option under the _Sender Info_ section.
  * Enter the desired address information and select a verified domain from the dropdown menu.
  * Click **Save**.

# Troubleshoot common issues

## Invalid records

Typically, we'd suggest that you copy and paste the host values provided in
your account:

    
    
    scph1218._domainkey
    s1._domainkey
    s2._domainkey
    privy-sg
    privy._verification
    

However, some providers will not verify when your brand and top-level domains
are excluded from these host values. For example, if you enter privy-sg in the
Host Name, the provider will throw an error because it expects privy-
sg.yourdomain.com instead.

Add your domain information to each host value to troubleshoot this issue and
input those values instead. After adding your domain to the records, they will
look something like the following:

    
    
    scph1218._domainkey.yourdomain.com
    s1._domainkey.yourdomain.com
    s2._domainkey.yourdomain.com
    privy-sg.yourdomain.com
    privy._verification.yourdomain.com
    

**Note:** It's okay if the TXT record for scphXXXX._domainkey is not verified.
In some cases, your domain will use the hosting provider's DKIM instead.

## Pending verification

In most cases, the records should be verified almost immediately when entered
into the host correctly. However, some changes will require up to 48 hours to
take effect. If your records have not been verified after 48 hours, please do
the following:

  * Review the "Why won't my DNS records verify?" [guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/87-why-havent-my-dns-records-verified).
  * Attempt the verification process again.
  * Contact your web host for assistance.
  * Explore the Privy Partner and Privy Support resources listed below.
