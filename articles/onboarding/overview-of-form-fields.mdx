Privyâ€™s form fields are detected attributes that enrich contact information
with data that Privy discovers automatically. This data may include the page
they were on when they signed up for a display, browser information, visit
history, and approximate location.

# How to use Profile Attributes

By adding hidden fields to the form of your Convert displays, you can choose
which detected attributes to attach to your contacts.

The following attributes are available:

## Available Attributes

  * **Coupon** \- The coupon code the visitor received after signing up. 
  * **Sessions count** \- The number of browser sessions this user has had on your site. A session ends after 30 minutes of inactivity.
  * **Pageviews all time** \- The number of pages this user has viewed across all known sessions on your site.
  * **Pageviews this session** \- The number of pages on your site this user has viewed this session.
  * **Current URL** \- The most recent URL the user was seen interacting with a display.
  * **Signup Date** \- The timestamp of when that contact registered. 
  * **UTM Medium** \- The UTM parameters (if present) of the URL where the contact signed up on a Privy form.

# How to review Detected Attributes

Detected attributes appear on individual contact records, in contact [exports
to CSV](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/159-how-to-export-your-
contacts), and when [syncing, display
signups](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/108-use-display-automation-
rules) to an external provider, such as an ESP.
