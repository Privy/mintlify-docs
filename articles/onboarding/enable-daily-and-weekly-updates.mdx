# Included information

The daily and weekly update emails are broken into three primary sections.

### Section One

The first section includes the reporting period and a performance snapshot of
all active displays during that period.

### Section Two

The second section expands on the performance snapshot by providing insight
into each of the active displays. displays that include forms will have data
concerning views, signups, and orders, while form-free displays will only have
data for views and clicks.

To help you quickly spot-check your display's conversion performance versus
the industry average, visual indicators may appear. The rates and indicators
are:

**Above 10%** = Great üåü | **Above 5%** = Good üëç   
---|---  
**3% - 4.9%** = A ‚ÄúView report‚Äù link| **Below 3%** = A ‚ÄúLogin to improve‚Äù link  
  
**Note:** Form-free displays do not have a conversion rate as they do not
collect information. Therefore, these displays will not include this
information.

### Section Three

The third section highlights the all-time performance of your Privy displays,
including the views, signups, orders, and revenue generated.

**Note:** Display Revenue is the total revenue collected from all contacts who
signed up via a Privy display and subsequently made a purchase. This revenue
attribution is only available to Privy accounts integrated with a Shopify or
BigCommerce storefront.
