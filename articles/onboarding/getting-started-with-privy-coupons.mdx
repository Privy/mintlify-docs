The discounts and incentives offered via coupons are a great way to close a
deal, entice subscribers to return to your site, or reward customer loyalty.
The resources below will help jumpstart those initiatives by ensuring you know
what options are available to you.

## Connect your e-commerce store

Connecting your e-commerce store to Privy adds a unique Privy code to your
website so you can exhibit your displays and track your website events (e.g.,
display views). Additionally, this connection allows you to unlock powerful
features, such as product segmentation and coupon syncing, that can help you
close even more sales with less effort. Connect your store by following [these
steps](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-your-site).

## Create a coupon code

The discounts provided via coupon codes are a great way to reward loyal
customers or encourage customers to take a specific action, such as completing
a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. Coupons created or uploaded to
Privy are easily seen in your displays, emails, or texts. Start creating and
managing coupons by following [these
steps](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/72-create-and-manage-coupon-
codes).

## Insert coupons into the content

Privy empowers you to include coupons in your displays, thank you pages,
autoresponders, emails, and text messages. Start incorporating your coupons
into your content by following [these
steps](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/28-insert-a-coupon-into-your-
content).

## Track orders

If your e-commerce store is connected to Privy, you can see how many display
signups eventually became customers by completing a purchase. The best part is
that the customer does not need to use a coupon code at the time of purchase
for an order to be registered and tracked.

Instead, Privy will automatically look for contacts who registered via a Privy
display and track whether they complete a purchase. If they do, Privy will add
an "order" event to the contact's profile and increase the overall order count
associated with the display and your account. [Learn

order).
