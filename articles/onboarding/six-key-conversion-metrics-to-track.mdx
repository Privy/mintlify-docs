The [Reports](https://dashboard.privy.com/reports) tool makes it easy to
review how your displays and their associated autoresponders are performing.
Below are six of the metrics that you should be looking at regularly.

More information on using the Report tool is available
[here](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/25-overview-of-privy-reports).

# Signup Rate

This metric shows you what percentage of people who see your displays are
signing up. If your rate is low, you may want to check your offer, adjust your
template, or modify your targeting.

# Order Rate

This metric shows the percentage of people who have received a discount code
and actually made a purchase. To improve this number, you may want to test
multiple offers and see what performs best.

# Signups by Display Type

Not sure whether you want to be using popups, flyouts, banners, or bars?
Comparing the signups of each display type can help you decide what type of
display to build next.

# Signups by Display Trigger

Wondering if exit intent is driving more signups than a timer or scroll
trigger? Using this metric, you can see which triggers are most effective at
driving signups across one or all of your displays.

# Link Clicks for Each Display

If you’re using “no form” displays or just including links in your displays,
you can see which links are performing best for one display or across all of
them.

# Signups by Source

This metric shows you where your site's most qualified traffic is coming from
based on the UTM Source. If you’re spending money to drive people to your
site, you can use this information to invest more or less based on the
results.
