Images are crucial for making messages easy to understand. Because the human
brain processes images better than written language, photos and other visual
designs convey information faster than text, reducing the readerâ€™s response
time to the message. [Studies show](https://medium.com/@iDashboards_UK/on-
average-people-remember-only-20-of-what-they-read-but-80-of-what-they-
see-8411224769e2) that people only remember 10% of what they hear and 20% of
what they read, but 80% of what they see.

## Adding Images and Product Images

The _Photo Manager_ helps you assemble an image collection to create your
designs. It previews your account images and allows you to upload new ones.
There are two ways to access it, depending on if you're creating a _Campaign_
or an _Email:_

### In a Convert Campaign

To add an image to your Convert Campaign:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays,** choose an existing Display or click **New Display**.
  * In the right side panel, click on the image or background image you want to replace.
  * On the resulting pop-up, choose whether you would like to add an image from your device or a product image from your Shopify catalog.

## Best practices for using marketing images

### Brand identity

Maintaining your brand identity is essential for immediate recognition by
email recipients. Remember that the quality of your images affects how your
brand is perceived; therefore, design aesthetics, style elements, and images
must look professional and match your identity.

### Relevance

The images in your campaigns and emails should be relevant to your message.
Everything must be consistent, from the subject line to the CTA (call-to-
action). Remember to provide a clear offer in each campaign or email, and
ensure that everything in your message implies that.

### File type and size

Following Privy's file types and size recommendations ensures visitors have
the optimal experience when engaging with your campaigns or emails. Please
take a look at the [guidelines for creative
assets](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/80-guidelines-for-creative-
assets) for details.

### Alt text

Complying with [ADA guidelines](https://www.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/)
for Web Accessibility requires including alt text in your images. Rename your
image files to the desired alt text, and Privy will automatically set it up on
the image upload. Remember to keep your last text concise and to include
keywords. For more information on ADA compliance with Privy, visit [this
