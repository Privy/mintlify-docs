Multiple after signup actions are available for Privy Convert displays that
utilize a signup form. When using the _Redirect to URL_ action, advanced users
may choose to pass contact attributes to the destination page by customizing
the URL with variables. Passing an attribute in this manner allows users to
leverage advanced functions on their pages, such as pre-populating data for
tracking purposes or dynamic content.

# Manage after signup actions

A display's  _After Signup Action_ setting becomes available once a display
(e.g., Popup) design and form field options have been selected. To configure
this setting:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays** and choose the desired display.
  * Navigate to the **Create** step of the display builder.
  * Select the **After Signup Action** option. If it is not available, ensure that the display's[ design](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/100-use-the-build-your-own-display-designer) and [form field options](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/118-overview-of-form-fields) are selected.

# Supported attributes

The following attributes can be passed from the form to the destination URL:

  * signup.coupon_code
  * display.id
  * contact.email
  * contact.first_name
  * contact.last_name
  * contact.custom_fields

**Note:** Variables are only available if they're collected during the signup
event that results in the redirect. Attributes collected from prior signups or
imports will not populate.

# How to pass attributes

Attributes are passed to the destination page by applying a specific format to
the URL added to the _Redirect to URL_ setting of your display.

### Default field example

To format your after signup URL to pass two standard contact attributes, such
as first name and last name, use this format:

    
    
    https://www.yourstore.com?{{contact.first_name}}&{{contact.last_name}}
    

After a contact signs up, the redirected link will look something like this:

    
    
    https://www.yourstore.com/?Jane&Doe
    

### Custom or Hidden field example

To pass a custom contact field, including [hidden
fields](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/63-use-hidden-form-fields)
like referring URL, use this format:

    
    
    https://yourstore.com?{{contact.custom_fields.referring_url}}
    

In this example, referring_url is the name and variable of a detected
attribute.

After a contact signs up, the redirected link will look something like this:

    
    
    https://yourstore.com/?referring_url=Google
