If you're already using campaigns to grow your contact list, you should also
consider replacing the embedded form (e.g., Newsletter) in the body content of
your Shopify store with one from Privy. This replacement ensures that all your
contacts -- wherever they sign up on your site -- sync with your Privy account
and its [linked accounts](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts).

**Note:** To add your embedded form to the footer of your Shopify store,
follow [these steps](https://help.privy.com/article/511-add-a-form-to-your-
shopify-footer) instead.

# Configuration

Once you've [created](https://help.privy.com/article/511-add-a-form-to-your-
shopify-footer) your Privy form, replace your Shopify form by following these
steps:

  * Navigate to the **Online Store** > **Themes** section of your Shopify account.
  * Select the **Customize** button of your store theme. 
  * If you have a **Newsletter** section included on your page, click on the section and remove it. If you don't have this section in your content, you can skip this step. 
  * Disable the default Shopify form on the footer.
  * Select the [+] Add section option from the sidebar and search for Custom liquid block to add it.

  * In another browser tab, open your Privy account and navigate to the [Convert](https://dashboard.privy.com/campaigns) dashboard.
  * Locate and select the desired embedded form campaign and open the **Create** section.
  * Click the **Get embed code** button on the _Embedded Form Design_ card. 
  * Copy the entire embed code from the prompt.

  * Return to your Shopify tab, Click on the custom liquid you previously added, and paste the Privy embed code into the custom liquid HTML box.
  * Select the **Save** button in the upper right to load the newly embedded form and ensure it matches your page's layout and design.

Congratulations! Your Privy embedded form is now in the body content of your
Shopify store. If you're not using [Privy
Email](https://help.privy.com/article/46-get-started-privy-email), ensure that
your embedded form syncs your signups to any other system. Update these
settings in the **Follow-up** section of the form builder.

# Troubleshooting

If you're encountering issues with your embedded forms on Shopify, please
attempt the following:

### Disable reCAPTCHA

To disable the reCAPTCHA for your Privy forms:

  * Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your _Business Settings_. 
  * Scroll down and locate the _Invisible reCAPTCHA_ section. 
  * Disable the **Enable Invisible reCAPTCHA** checkbox. 
  * Click the **Save** button.

Please contact support via email or chat if this doesn't correct the issue.

**Note** : When reCAPTCHA is disabled via your account settings, Privy is
effectively vouching for your registration process and will attempt to waive
all reCAPTCHA requirements. However, if behavioral analysis suspects that a
user may be a bot or that spam activities are taking place, reCAPTCHA can
still fire in the background. This aspect of reCAPTCHA cannot be disabled as
it is currently one of the best ways to protect Privy merchants from
suspicious or abusive activity.
