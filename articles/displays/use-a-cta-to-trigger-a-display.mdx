If you'd like a visitor to manually trigger one of your Convert displays by
clicking a specific call-to-action (CTA), you can use an onClick JavaScript
function.

**Note:** Custom JavaScript is outside the scope of Privy Support. The team
cannot help you implement this on your site or troubleshoot issues related to
its use.

# Prepare the display

To properly trigger the display without conflicts:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**.
  * Select the display you'd like to trigger. 
  * Navigate to the **Create** step of the display builder.
  * Make sure the **Tab Design** setting is set to **No tab**.

  * Navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. 
  * Select the **Scheduling** card and ensure all the **Automatically Show** settings are disabled.

  * **Save** the changes and **Publish** the display. 

# Create and apply the function

To create the onClick JavaScript function that triggers the display:

  * Take note of the URL displayed when viewing the display page and copy the number listed after the display. This is the display's ID.

  * To create the button, add the function listed below to your site's HTML. Make sure to replace "XYZ" with your display number, update the button text, and style the button to match your site's branding. 

    
    
    <button onClick="Privy('show', XYZ);">Attend Our Event</button>
    

# See it in use

Once you add the button to your content, a visitor's click will trigger the
display:
