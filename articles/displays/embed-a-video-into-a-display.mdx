Whether creating a welcome video for your website or offering a video as
premium content once a visitor has registered, it is easy to embed videos in
your displays like the YouTube video shown in the example below.

Note: At this time, videos can only be embedded into Classic Displays

To add a video to your display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays** and choose or create a display. 
  * In the **Create** step of the display builder, select the **Design** card to open the display editor. The card is labeled with the type of display you've selected (e.g., Popup or Spin to Win). 
  * In the display designer, use the **Add element** option on the sidebar to insert an **HTML** element into your display. 
  * Select the element and insert embed code from YouTube, Wistia, or other video hosting sites. After inserting the code, you may need to change the embed code or the design of your display to accommodate the video's iframe.

  * Once you've made your changes, select **Save** at the top-right.

All set! The display now includes a video.
