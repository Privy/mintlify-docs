The most common display shapes used for displays are square, rectangle, and
circle. Each of these shapes is easily implemented via the display designer.
However, your creativity doesn't need to stop there. Combining a transparent
background with a background image means that your displays can take on all
kinds of non-traditional shapes and styles.

**Note:** You must use a Classic Display in order to design a custom-shaped
display

# Swap between default shapes

Before you use custom shapes, it's best to know how to swap between the
default square, rectangle, and circle shapes offered by the display designer.
To swap between these default options and tweak their settings:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and select the display you want to edit. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the **Design** card (e.g., Popup Design). 
  * In the display designer, select the **Background** option from the sidebar. 

From here, edit the width, height, colors, border, and rounding of the
display. Based on your starting point, you can swap between a square or
rectangle to a circle by enabling or disabling the **Circular background**
checkbox.

# Use a custom-shape

To create a custom-shaped display, you need an image, preferably a PNG, of the
desired shape. Once you have the desired image ready, follow these steps to
create your display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and select the display you want to edit. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the **Design** card (e.g., Popup Design). 
  * In the display designer, select the **Background** option from the sidebar. 
  * In the _Background_ section, set the display's background color to transparent. To do this, set any A value in an RGBA color to 0 or move the transparency slider all the way to the left. 
  * Next, click the **Choose Image** button in the _Background_ section and upload/select the desired custom shape. If you see an unexpected checkered background associated with an image, the background included in the file wasn't truly transparent. You must edit the file to remove the checkered area or find a new file with no background. 

Here, edit the alignment, size, width, height, overlay, and other display
settings. Depending on the size of your custom shape, you may need to select
the **Edit Background** button at the top of the sidebar to access the
display's other elements (e.g., Form and text) so they fit appropriately.

## Additional changes

Depending on your custom shape, you may want to remove additional default
design elements for your display. For example, the **X** icon is used to close
the display. If you'd like to make this type of change, check out [this
