Privy's display triggers are a set of rules that allow you to reveal a display
to a visitor based on the passage of time or a specific series of actions. The
triggers help to ensure your visitors see the right message at the right time.

**Note** : A display trigger only fires (activates) if the visitor meets the
display's [audience targeting
conditions](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-
conditions) (e.g., All audiences or Mobile visitors). This means it's
important to plan your _When To Show_ and _Who To Show It To_ settings
together.

# Edit a display's triggers

The Settings step of the display builder allows you to customize a display's
triggers. Simply select the Triggers and Visibility card, select the desired
option(s), and save.

# Available display triggers

There are four primary trigger settings for a display:

  1. **Time on page** – This setting allows you to show the display to qualifying visitors after the selected time on the page has passed. The countdown begins after the page has loaded. 
  2. **Show on scroll** – This setting allows you to show the display to qualifying visitors after they've scrolled down a certain amount. This trigger is only recommended for longer pages. 
  3. **Show on exit-intent** – This setting allows you to show the display to qualifying visitors when their mouse movement indicates an intent to leave your site. For example, their cursor may move toward options like the back button or the address bar. 
  4. **Limit display appearance** \- This setting lets Privy know how often to re-display the display to a visitor who has not signed up.
  5. **Automatically end the display after** \- The display will no longer be shown on your site after the sign-up goal is reached.

# Display behavior

Multiple trigger settings can be active for a single display; however,
visitors can only see a display once per visit. For example, if your display
is set to appear after 10 seconds and after 50% scroll, the visitor will only
see the display for whichever trigger occurs first.

**Note:** Regardless of what you have selected for the frequency setting, if a
visitor signs up, Privy automatically suppresses the display from showing to
that same person again.
