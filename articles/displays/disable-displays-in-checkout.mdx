To prevent your displays from appearing during or after checkout, you can just
use the URL targeting settings available while in the Target step of the
display designer.

To configure these settings:

  * Select Convert > All Displays from the main navigation in your Privy account. 
  * Select the display you'd like to edit from the dashboard. 
  * Select the **Settings** step from the display builder.
  * Select the **Audience Targeting** card. 
  * Select the **Property** option "_Current URL "_
  * Next, choose the " does not contain" Operator
  * In the _Value_ text area, input the key terms in the browser bar during your store's checkout flow. Input each term on a separate line. Common terms include _cart_ , _checkout_ , and _thank-you,_ but these terms differ by provider. Check out the example term below:

  * After inputting your terms, select the **Save** option to lock in your changes.

Nice work! Moving forward, the display won't appear during the checkout
process.
