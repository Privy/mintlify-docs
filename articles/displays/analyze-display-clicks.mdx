If you include text or button-based links in your displays, it is easy to see
which links are driving the most engagement via the reports dashboard. This
information allows you to build better displays and make your customerâ€™s
journey easier.

**Note:** The "clicks" metric does not increase when a visitor interacts with
a button or link that submits or dismisses a display. The hyperlinked content
must point to a provided URL.

# Access the reports dashboard

Select **Convert** > **Reports** from the navigation bar to access the
reporting dashboard.

# Create a click-tracking report

To create a click-tracking report:

  * Select **Link clicks** as your metric. 
  * Then, choose how you want to compare the results - by the display, display trigger, display type, origin URL (where the click happened), or destination URL (where the link takes you).
  * Select **All Displays** or a specific display. 
  * Select your desired dates via the **Start date** and **End date** filters. 

For example, the report below shows the clicks per day for all displays active
in January 2021.
