Unfortunately, thank you pages are often an afterthought. They have huge
potential for nurturing leads, building customer trust, and increasing sales.
This guide outlines some best practices and recommendations that will
transform your Thank You pages from simple confirmation messages to motivating
calls to action.

# Best Practices

While the audience of your thank-you page is likely to vary, each one should
have these elements.

## A confirmation

Your thank you page must include a confirmation that the userâ€™s action was
successful to ensure a good user experience and fulfill its traditional
purpose.

Be clear and concise to avoid leaving the user confused or uncertain.

## A call-to-action

A clear, action-oriented CTA helps motivate users to take another desirable
step with your brand.

Some great thank-you page use cases include:

  * Ask them to share on social media. 
  * Ask them if they want another product, service, or resource. 
  * Ask them to fill out a survey or provide a review. 

Please ensure the call-to-action gives the user added value; otherwise, they
will likely not take the desired additional action(s).

## Instructions for what comes next

It may seem obvious after reviewing the previous examples, but it's worth
repeating: Be specific. Provide the user with information and instructions on
what they should do and how to do it.

# Customize a thank you page

To customize an enabled thank-you page in a Build Your Own Display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and create or select a display. 
  * In the _Create_ step, select the **Thank You Page** option at the bottom of the page. The default thank-you page includes a generic confirmation message, a merge tag to display any [coupons](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/72-create-and-manage-coupon-codes) attached to the display, and social sharing options. 
  * If you'd like to personalize the thank-you page with additional merge tags, check out [this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/178-personalize-your-displays) on personalizing displays.
