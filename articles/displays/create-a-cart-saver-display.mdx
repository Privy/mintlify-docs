A Cart Saver display encourages visitors who have started the checkout process
to complete their purchase if they indicate that they are about to leave. It
combines exit-intent triggers with a popup display, page targeting, and a
special offer to ensure that you're taking your best shot at closing a sale
every time.

examples](https://www.privy.com/customer-examples).

**Note** : The audience targeting used in this guide is only available to
Privy accounts integrated with BigCommerce, Shopify, Squarespace, or Wix
storefronts.

  * Customize the display to reflect the associated offer (e.g., 10% or $5 off) and your company branding. 
  * Once the design is complete, select the **Settings s** tep.

# Target the right audience

By default, a cart saver display created using the Cart Saver play appears to
visitors who have:

  * Met your selected trigger criteria (e.g., An exit attempt).
  * Have products valued at more than $0 in their cart. 
  * Have not already signed up for another display. 

The display will continue until it is disabled. To change any of these default
options, move to the Settings step and customize the desired settings.

  1. The **Triggers and Visibility** setting allows you to determine when and how often the free shipping bar appears to visitors. After making any changes, please select **Save**. 
  2. The **Audience Targeting** setting allows you to target a more specific segment of your visitors instead of all visitors. If you update these settings to include various other [attributes, activities, and behaviors](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-conditions), please select **Save**. 
  3. The **Scheduling** setting determines how long the display will appear to visitors. Update the settings. If you'd like the display to expire on a specific fixed date, then save it. 
  4. The **Coupon** setting (optional) allows you to offer an additional coupon code for a discount.

### **Advanced Settings**

Advanced settings give you even more control over the behavior of your
display.

  1. **Sign Up Rules** control how often a contact can sign up for your display. By default, this is set to once. 
  2. **Opt-in:**_Single opt-in -_ Subscribe new contacts to your email list upon signup. Contacts become mailable upon form submission. _Double Opt-in_ \- Send new contacts an opt-in confirmation email upon signup. Contacts become mailable after they confirm via email.

# Follow-up display

To sync the display's signups to another service or send a follow-up message
to the customers who have signed up, move to the _Follow-up_ step and review
the following optional options:

  1. Enable and customize the [default after-signup email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/166-set-up-an-after-signup-email) to send an email to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display. 
  2. Select the **Add Email to Series** option to send additional after-signup emails. 
  3. Select the **Create After Sign Up Text** option to send an[ after-signup text message](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/242-set-up-an-after-signup-text) to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display. 

**Note:** The text message option requires a [Privy
Text](https://www.privy.com/pricing) subscription. Additionally, a customer is
only eligible to receive texts if their phone number was collected via a Privy
display using the phone field, they checked the text opt-in checkbox, and they
answered "YES" to the double opt-in message sent to their number.
