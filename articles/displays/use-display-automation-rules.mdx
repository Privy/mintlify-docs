Privy Convert displays can sync collected contacts to a connected email
marketing service using sync integrations. These rules must be configured for
each display individually.

# Prepare to sync contacts

Before following the steps outlined below, please ensure that your account is
correctly integrated with one of the supported services listed in the
[Integrations](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts) section of your
account. Additional information for configuring a supported integration is
available [here](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/177-overview-privy-
integrations).

# Add an automation rule

To add an automation rule to a display so that the collected contacts sync to
an external service:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays**. 
  * Select the desired display and navigate to the **Settings** step of the display builder. 
  * Select **Show Advanced Settings** at the bottom of the page
  * Click the **Sync Integrations** card, select the desired integration from the dropdown menu, configure the presented options, and **Save**.

This display's signups will now sync to the selected provider.

**Note:** These settings must be set individually for each display.

# Troubleshoot automation issues

To troubleshoot syncing issues related to automation rules, please review
these common issues.

### Check the integration's connection

An integration's connection may expire or disconnect for various reasons. To
ensure that Privy and the external service are still properly integrated:

  * Navigate to **Account** > **Integrations**. 
  * Locate the **Linked Accounts** section. 
  * Select the **Test Account** option. 

This will trigger a reading (e.g., Connection Successful) that will help guide
your next steps.

### Check the double opt-in settings

If you have enabled double opt-in when configuring the automation rule or your
marketing service requires double opt-in, new signups will generally not
appear until contacts have completed the confirmed opt-in process. Please
review the submissions of any contacts presumed missing from the sync and
ensure the contact provided the required opt-in.

### Check contact addresses

Not all contacts can be synced. Many services will reject certain classes of
emails, including:

  * Obviously fake emails, like “test@example.com”
  * Role-based email addresses, like “service@example.com”
  * Emails from disposable email services
  * Emails that have previously unsubscribed from your newsletter
  * Known spam traps or emails that are otherwise blacklisted

Even when Privy successfully syncs a contact, the service may reject it for
any of the above reasons. Privy has no way to override this decision.
