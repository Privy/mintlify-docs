A bar display attaches to the top or bottom of the web page and can remain
visible as your visitors navigate around. Itâ€™s a great way to get your
visitors' attention without interrupting their experience like a popup might
and takes up less screen space than a banner display. This display is perfect
for collecting a single field of information, such as an email address, or
displaying a promotional message like an ongoing sale.

Common variations of this display include a [free shipping
bar](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/43-create-a-free-shipping-bar) or
[coupon reminder](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/187-create-a-coupon-
reminder). Both of which have their own standalone guides linked above.

# Create the display

To create a bar display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and click on the **New Display** button. 
  * On the _Templates_ dashboard, select Get Started under the "Prefer the classic creation experience?" card on the bottom right of the page, provide an internal name, and then click the **Create Display** button. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the desired**Form fields** and **Validations** for the display if you hope to collect signups. One field is recommended, while the validation depends on your intended audiences and desired discount availability. If the display is for an announcement and doesn't need a form element, disable the **Enable Form?** option.

EpL2yzQRyx.gif)

  * Next, select the **Add a Display** option. 
  * Select the **Bar** option from the sidebar, customize a template, and then click the **Choose Selected** option in the upper right. 
  * Use the [display designer](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/181-should-i-use-a-play-or-build-my-own-display) to configure it to your liking. To remove the "X" from the display to make it look more like a traditional banner message, add an HTML element to the display and include the code listed below. 

    
    
    <style>
    .privy-bar-container .privy-dismiss-content {
    display: none;
    }
    </style>
    

  * Select the **Save** option at the upper right when you are done with your changes.

  * After saving, a new _Bar Design_ section will be available under the _Create_ tab if the display includes a form element. It's best practice to use a thank-you page after sign up action; however, you can opt to redirect the user or do nothing instead.
  * If the bar offers a discount, make sure to select a coupon from the _Coupon codes_ section and include the {{ signup.coupon_code }} merge tag in the thank-you page or the after-signup message. This tag populates with your coupon code information automatically and ensures the selected coupon is provided to the visitor.

# Target the right audience

By default, a bar display appears to all visitors at all times until it is
dismissed. To change any of these default options, move to the _Target_ step,
and customize the desired settings.

  1. The **When To Show** setting allows you to determine when and how often the display appears to visitors. After making any changes, please select **Save**. 
  2. The **Who To Show It To** setting allows you to target a more specific segment of your visitors instead of all visitors. If you update these settings to include various other [attributes, activities, and behaviors](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/70-use-audience-targeting-conditions), please select **Save**. 
  3. The **How Long to Show It** setting determines how long the display will appear to visitors. Update the setting if you'd like the display to expire on a specific fixed date, then **Save**.

# Follow-up the display

**Note:** The display must include a form component for these options to
appear.

To sync the display's signups to another service or send a follow-up message
to the customers who submitted the display if the display included a form
element, move to the _Follow-up_ step, and review the following optional
options:

  1. Enable and customize the [default after-signup email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/166-set-up-an-after-signup-email) to send an email to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display. 
  2. Select the **Create series** option to send additional after-signup emails. 
  3. Select the **Sync signups** option to sync the signups to a list in a [linked account](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts). If you're not using [Privy Email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/46-get-started-privy-email), this setting is particularly important as it ensures the contact information (e.g., Email address) is available in the third-party provider.
  4. Select the **Send text message** option to send an[ after-signup text message](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/242-set-up-an-after-signup-text) to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display. 
  5. The **Notifications** setting allows you to enable or disable real-time notifications for your users. These notifications will alert the user of new display signups immediately. If there's no form, then this option will not appear. If you make any changes, please select **Save**.

up_options_6.png)

**Note:** The text message option requires a [Privy
Text](https://www.privy.com/pricing) subscription. Additionally, a customer is
only eligible to receive texts if their phone number was collected via a Privy
display using the phone field, they checked the text opt-in checkbox, and they
answered "YES" to the double opt-in message sent to their number.

# Launch the display

Once the display has been created, the target audience selected, and any
desired follow-up messages configured, select the **Publish** button at the
upper right of the display builder and confirm your decision in the prompt.

The bar display is now live and will appear to your qualifying customers.
