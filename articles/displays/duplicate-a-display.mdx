Convert displays can be duplicated in a single account or copied between
accounts.

**Note:** You must be registered as a user with the same email address in both
accounts in order to copy a display between them.

# Create a duplicate

Duplicates can be made within a single account in one of two ways.

  * From the [Convert](https://dashboard.privy.com/campaigns) dashboard, select the **Duplicate** button on the display you'd like to duplicate and confirm your decision in the prompt. 
  * Select the Duplicate button on the upper right portion of the screen from within the display builder. The option will be in the same area for each display status (e.g., Draft vs. Active).

# Copy to another account

To copy a display from one account to another, you must have your accounts
linked. You can switch between accounts by clicking the account button (where
your business name appears) and selecting **Switch Business**.

  * Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays**. 
  * Select the **Duplicate** button on the display you want to copy.
  * In the prompt, select the account to which you'd like to send the copy from the dropdown menu. 
  * Confirm your decision by clicking the **Copy display** button.

**Note:** The following display attributes are maintained in the cross-account
copy: Form configuration, validations, display and thank-you page design,
after-signup action, targeting rules, triggers, and schedule. Attributes or
settings unique to the original account, such as automation rules,
notifications, and custom fonts, will not be copied between the accounts.
