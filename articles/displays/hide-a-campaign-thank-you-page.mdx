A [thank-you page](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/158-create-an-
effective-thank-you-page) provides immediate feedback to the visitor following
signup. A thank-you message is typically recommended but may not be necessary
or desired in all situations, such as when a campaign provides immediate
feedback via an after-signup message instead.

Note: You must use the Classic Display designer in order to hide the Thank You
Page

To remove a campaign's thank-you page:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Campaigns** and select the desired campaign. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the campaign builder, select the **After Signup Action** card. 
  * Select the **Do Nothing** action and then click the **Save** button.

All set! When contacts sign up, the campaign will hide without displaying a
thank-you page.
