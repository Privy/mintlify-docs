Gated content is any type of content that visitors can only access after
exchanging their information. Essentially, the content is hidden behind a
display and requires a visitor to sign up. Gated content is great for lead
generation as it entices visitors to sign up while simultaneously identifying
an area of interest. Compelling types of gated content include white papers,
ebooks, and webinars.

With Privy, there are several ways to gate content. These are:

  * Include a download link in your display thank-you page.
  * Include a download link in your after-signup message. 
  * Immediately redirect the visitor to the content following their signup. 

While most displays support content gating, the [landing
page](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/44-create-a-landing-page) is
particularly well-suited. Learn more about using each "gating" approach,
including the common pros and cons below.

# Content via thank-you page

Offering your gated content via a display's thank-you page is immediate and
straightforward and removes the possibility of the content going to promotions
or spam. However, the content is not easily referenceable unless the visitor
saves it or bookmarks its hosting location. To offer content via a display's
thank-you page:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays** and select the desired display. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the **After Signup Action** card. 
  * Select the **Show thank you page** action and then click the **Save** button.
  * Next, select the **Thank You Page Design** card to open the editor.
  * Include a download link in the page's design. Depending on your desired presentation, this can be via linked text, a linked picture, or a button. Whatever your approach, make it obvious to the visitor that they must click the element to receive their offer.
  * After making your changes, click the **Save** button in the top-right of the editor.

Visitors who sign up for this display will be prompted to download your offer.

# Content via after-signup message

Offering your gated content via a display after-signup message is quick and
straightforward and makes revisiting or sharing the content very easy.
However, there is a possibility that the message gets routed to the
recipient's promotions or spam folder, and the shareability factor may not be
desirable in all situations. To offer content via a display after signup
message:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays** and select the desired display.
  * In the _Follow-up_ step of the display builder, select the **Subject line** of the default after signup message to access the email editor.
  * Include a download link in the email's design. This is possible via linked text, a linked picture, or a button depending on your desired presentation. Whatever your approach, make it obvious to the visitor that they must click the element to receive their offer. After making your changes, click the **Save** button in the top-right of the editor.
  * Lastly, make sure that the **Published?** toggle is enabled and in the ON position.

Visitors who sign up for this display will receive an email with the download
link.

# Content via redirect

Offering your gated content via a display redirect is quick and
straightforward, making saving or sharing the content easy. However, his
approach takes the visitor's attention away from your website, and the
shareability factor may not be desirable in all situations. To offer content
via a display's redirect:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays** and select the desired display.
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the **After Signup Action** card.
  * Select the **Redirect to URL** action and paste your download link into the field.
  * After making your changes, click the **Save** button.

Visitors who sign up for this display will be provided the offer immediately.
