Popup, flyout, banner, and spin-to-win displays, each support tabs. The tabs
can be placed and styled in various ways for both desktop and mobile views.
The tabs allow the display to be manually triggered by a visitor, which is
particularly useful if you are hoping to create a minimally invasive offer or
would like to provide visitors the opportunity to open a previously dismissed
offer. Still not exactly sure what this guide is talking about? Check out the
example below:

# Add tabs

To add tabs to a compatible display type:

  * Navigate to **Convert** >**All Displays.**
  * Select the display for which you'd like to include tabs. 
  * Navigate to the **Create** step of the display builder.

# Tab behavior

Tabs act as a complementary means of activation for displays that use Triggers
and Visibility settings to appear to visitors automatically. However, the tab
serves as the only way for a visitor to activate and engage with displays that
have all automatic triggers disabled.
