Once you've created a display, you will find it on your Convert dashboard
after logging into your account. Editing a display you've already begun
working on or a display that's already been published only takes a few simple
steps.

Privy has two editors for Displays. The steps for editing a display vary
slightly depending on the display editor used.

# Edit an Existing Template Display

  * Navigate to Convert > All Displays
  * Locate the display that you'd like to edit and click it. The search bar and dropdown menu filters make this process quick and easy. 
  * A template Display will bring you straight into the Dislay editor
  * Make any changes needed
  * Save, Publish, or Update the Live Display
