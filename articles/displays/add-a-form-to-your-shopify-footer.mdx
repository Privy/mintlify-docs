If you're already using displays to grow your contact list, you should also
consider replacing the embedded form (e.g., Newsletter) in the footer of your
Shopify store with one from Privy. This replacement ensures that all your
contacts, wherever they sign up on your site, sync with your Privy account and
its linked accounts.

**Note:** To add an embedded form to the body of your Shopify store, follow
[these steps](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/90-add-a-form-to-your-
shopify-page) instead.

**Note:** You can follow the **Configuration** steps only if you want to use a
"text block" to add the Privy form on your Shopify footer.

You can always use a "Custom Liquid Section" to add the embedded form to the
Shopify footer without following the **Configuration** steps.

  * Return to your Shopify tab and select the **Themes** option from the sidebar. 
  * On the _Themes_ dashboard, click on the **Customize** button. 
  * In the _Sections_ sidebar, select the **Footer** section and then add a **Text** element. 
  * Paste your Privy form's embed code into the _Text_ element. Drag and drop the element to edit its placement. Moving the element higher will move it left, while lowering it will move the form to the right. Select the **Save** button in the upper right after each change to reload and preview the form.

Congratulations! Your Privy embedded form is now in the footer of your Shopify
site. If you're not using [Privy
Email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/46-get-started-privy-email),
ensure that your embedded form syncs your signups to any other system. Update
these settings in the **Follow-up** section of the form builder.

# Troubleshooting

If you're encountering issues with your embedded forms on Shopify, please
attempt the following:

### Disable reCAPTCHA

To disable the reCAPTCHA for your Privy forms:

  * Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your _Business Settings_. 
  * Scroll down and locate the _Invisible reCAPTCHA_ section. 
  * Disable the **Enable Invisible reCAPTCHA** checkbox. 
  * Click the **Save** button.

Please contact support via email or chat if this doesn't correct the issue.

**Note** : When reCAPTCHA is disabled via your account settings, Privy
effectively vouches for your registration process and will attempt to waive
all reCAPTCHA requirements. However, if behavioral analysis suspects that a
user may be a bot or that spam activities are occurring, reCAPTCHA can still
fire in the background. This aspect of reCAPTCHA cannot be disabled as it is
currently one of the best ways to protect Privy merchants from suspicious or
abusive activity.
