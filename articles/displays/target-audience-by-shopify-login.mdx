Privy's audience targeting rules are a collection of conditions that allow you
to target individuals with specific displays so that you can display the right
message, to the right person, at the right time. This guide reviews how to
leverage some custom JavaScript to show a display to individuals who are or
are not logged in during their visit.

**Note:** You must use a Classic Display in order to target users by Shopify
login

# Target logged-in visitors

To add a targeting condition that will only show the display to visitors who
are logged into their Shopify account for your store:

  * Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays** via the main navigation. 
  * Select or create a display and navigate to the **Target** step in the display builder.
  * Select the **Who To Show It To** section and then the **Add targeting condition** button. 
  * Select the **Custom JavaScript** option from the _Property_ dropdown menu. 
  * Paste the code listed below into the _Value_ field. 

    
    
    if (window.__st) {
    
    return (__st.cid != null); 
    
    }
    
    return false;
    

  * Click the **Save** button to lock in your new targeting conditions.

That's it! Your display will now only include visitors who are logged into
their store accounts.

# Target logged-out visitors

To add a targeting condition that will only show the display to visitors who
are logged out of their Shopify account for your store:

  * Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays** via the main navigation. 
  * Select or create a display and navigate to the **Target** step in the display builder.
  * Select the **Who To Show It To** section and then the **Add targeting condition** button. 
  * Select the **Custom JavaScript** option from the _Property_ dropdown menu. 
  * Paste the code listed below into the Value field. 

    
    
    if (window.__st) {
    
    return (__st.cid == null);
    
    }
    
    return true;
    

  * Click the **Save** button to lock in your new targeting conditions.
