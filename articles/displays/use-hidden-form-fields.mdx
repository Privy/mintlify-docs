Profile Attribute fields can be used to pass values into a contact's profile
without requiring the contact to fill in that information on the display's
form. This approach allows you to use as few form fields as possible while
still collecting important information for your business. For example, when a
contact submits a display, you may want to note their location, their last
referring URL, or the coupon they were provided in the background.

# What Information is Collected?

The information that a Profile Attribute Field collects is either manually set
when creating the display or determined by a Detected Attribute. A Detected
Attribute is information that is automatically pulled from a visitor's browser
settings or cookies, added to the Profile Attributes field on the form, and
recorded in the contact's profile in Privy when the display is submitted. The
collected information can also be shared with external services, such as an
email service provider, via [a display automation
rule](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/108-use-display-automation-
rules).

# Add Profile Attributes to Forms

To add Profile Attributes to your form:

  * Navigate to the **Convert** > **All Displays** via the main navigation. 
  * Select a template display that includes a form. 
  * Select the **Settings** step of the display builder. 
  * Click **Show Advanced Settings** at the bottom of the page.
  * Select the **Profile Attributes section** at the bottom of the page. 
  * Configure the field's name and value. 
  * Select the **Save & Close** option.

**Note:** If you use an external service to send messages or store contact
information, it is important to [map the fields to that
service](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/123-create-and-use-field-
mapping). The mapping(s) ensure that all the data you collect in your form and
associated with your contacts appears in your database in the right spot. The
mapping(s) should be done before you launch your display.

# Where is the Information Stored?

A field that has been manually set by the Profile Attribute field is
reviewable in two places in your Privy account:

  1. The _Attributes_ section of the contact's profile. 
  2. The signup event is in the contact's profile. Additional information about the signup, including any provided Profile Attribute field values, is reviewable by selecting the **Details** button. 

To locate a contact's record, go to the Contacts dashboard via the main
navigation and search/select a contact from the table shown.
