A landing page is a standalone web page that is specifically designed to
receive and convert traffic from a marketing or advertising campaign. It's
where a visitor "lands" after they click on a link in an email, an ad, a
social post, or other web content. Unlike a traditional web page, which
typically encourages a visitor to explore additional content, landing pages
are designed with a single focus - convert the visitor into a lead.

A landing page achieves this goal by pairing a narrowly focused, action-
oriented call-to-action with a form to capture the visitor's information. This
display functions differently from the other display types in that it does not
show your existing site content. Instead, it is an entirely self-contained
display that you can direct your contacts to via a link.

**Note:** You must use a Classic Display in order to create a Landing Page

# Create the display

To create a landing page display:

  * Navigate to **Convert** > **All Displays** and click on the **New Display** button. 
  * On the _Templates_ dashboard, select Get Started under the "Prefer the classic creation experience?" card on the bottom right of the page, provide an internal name, and then click the **Create Display** button. 
  * In the _Create_ step of the display builder, select the desired [Form fields](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/168-create-and-manage-form-fields) and [Validations](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/60-use-form-validations-in-displays) for the display. Three fields or less are recommended, while the validation depends on your intended audiences and desired discount availability.

  * Next, select the **Add a Display** option. 
  * Select **Landing Page** from the sidebar, choose a template to customize, and then click the **Choose Selected** option in the upper right. 
  * Use the [display designer](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/100-use-the-build-your-own-display-designer) to configure the display to your liking.
  * Select the **Save** option at the upper right when you are done with your changes.

  * After saving, a new _Landing Page Design_ section will be available under the _Create_ tab. It's best practice to use a thank-you page after sign up action; however, you can opt to redirect the user or do nothing instead. 

# Target the right audience

Since a landing page display only appears when it is visited, the only
audience targeting option revolves around how long the page is available. If
you would like the display to expire after a fixed period, move to the
_Target_ step and update the **How Long to Show It** setting.

# Follow-up the display

To sync the display's signups to another service or send a follow-up message
to the customers who submitted the display, move to the _Follow-up_ step and
review the options below. Please note that accounts created before May 26,
2022, won't automatically enable after signup emails. Instead, you must
manually switch the **Published** toggle to the ON position.

  1. [After-signup emails](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/166-set-up-an-after-signup-email) are enabled by default on active displays, meaning that they will immediately start sending to new signups if the following criteria are met:

    * The display contains an email field and a [coupon code](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/72-create-and-manage-coupon-codes).
    * The account has a _Website URL_ address set on its [Business Information](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/business-info) page. 
    * The display type is not [Phone Capture](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/199-create-a-phone-capture-display) or [Two-Step](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/93-create-a-two-step-display). 

  2. Select the **Sync signups** option to sync the signups to a list in a [linked account](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/accounts). If you're not using [Privy Email](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/46-get-started-privy-email), this setting is particularly important as it ensures the contact information (e.g., email address) is available to the third-party provider.
  3. Select the **Send text message** option to send an[ after-signup text message](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/242-set-up-an-after-signup-text) to the individuals who decided to sign up for the display.
  4. Enable or disable real-time notifications for your users. These notifications will alert the user of new display signups immediately. **Save**. 

The text option requires a [Privy Text](https://www.privy.com/text)
subscription. Customers are only eligible to receive texts if their phone
number was collected via a Privy display using the phone field, they checked
the text opt-in checkbox, and they answered "YES" to the double opt-in message
sent to their number.

up_options_1.png)

# Launch the display

Once the display has been created, the target audience selected, and any
desired follow-up messages configured, select the **Publish** button at the
upper right of the _Follow-up step_ and confirm your decision in the prompt.

The landing page is now live and will be available at the link listed in the
_Design_ step next to the _Landing Page Design_ header.

**Note:** The landing page URL will only show when the display is published.
If you stop the display, the link will not appear until you have re-published
it.
