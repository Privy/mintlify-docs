reCAPTCHA is a service that protects your website from spam and abuse.
reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive CAPTCHAs to keep
automated software from engaging in abusive activities on your site. It does
this while letting your valid visitors pass through with ease.

# reCAPTCHA and Privy

Any form included in your Privy displays uses Google's [Invisible
reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/versions). The
"invisible" approach means that most of your visitors will submit a form
without ever needing to complete a reCAPTCHA test. In the background, Google
scans a visitor's behavior to determine whether this visitor is abusive,
spammy, or a bot. If Google believes one of those is true, the visitor will
see a reCAPTCHA test they must complete.

## Edit your settings

To enable or disable your account's reCAPTCHA settings:

  * Navigate to the [**Customizations**](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/customizations) sections of your _Business Settings_. 
  * Scroll down and locate the _Invisible reCAPTCHA_ section. 
  * Check or uncheck the **Enable Invisible reCAPTCHA** checkbox.
  * Click the **Save** button. 

If reCAPTCHA is disabled via your account settings, Privy effectively vouches
for your registration process and will attempt to waive all reCAPTCHA
requirements. However, if behavioral analysis suspects that a user may be a
bot or that spam activities are taking place, reCAPTCHA can still fire in the
background. This aspect of reCAPTCHA cannot be disabled as it is currently one
of the best ways to protect Privy merchants from suspicious or abusive
activity.
