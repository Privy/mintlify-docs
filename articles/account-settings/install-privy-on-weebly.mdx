A unique Privy code must be installed on your Weebly website in order to
display your displays and track your website events (e.g., display views). If
you're using a different provider, please review the instructions outlined in
[this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-your-
site) instead.

# Automatic install

The Privy app for Weebly performs this installation automatically without the
need for coding or development skills. If you would prefer to place the code
manually, please follow the _Manual Install_ steps instead.

  * Install Privyâ€™s official [Weebly app](http://www.weebly.com/app-center/privy). 
  * Navigate to your Weebly dashboard and publish your site to finish the installation.

# Manual install

The automatic installation provided by the Privy app for Weebly is recommended
for most users. Please confirm that the _Automatic Install_ does not fit your
situation before proceeding with a manual install.

## Copy the code

To manually install your code, you first need to copy it from your Privy
account's settings:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section. 
  * Locate and select the **Default** or **Asynchronous** tab to reveal its details. The default code is the preferred method to install Privy and will allow it to load in-line with everything else on your site. Meanwhile, the asynchronous code will load Privy last. 
  * Copy the selected code.

## Install the code

To manually install your Privy code onto a Weebly site:

  * Log in to your [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/app/front-door/signin?path=login#/) account and click **Edit**.
  * Navigate to **Settings** > **SEO** and paste your Privy code into the **Footer** section. 
  * **Save** , then publish your site**.**

# Verify the installation

The Privy code allows you to display your displays and monitor your website's
events (e.g., display views). If your displays aren't displaying properly or
event information is missing, verify that the code has been installed and that
it's firing correctly:

  * Select the **Account** option from the navigation bar in Privy. Your business name appears here. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section. 
  * In the _Installation Guides_ section, locate and copy your account identifier. 
  * Open a page on your website and right-click anywhere on the page.
  * In the dropdown menu, select **View page source** or **View source**.
  * Use **CTRL-F** or **CMD-F** to search for the identifier that you copied.

  * If the code appears, verify that it has been copied and pasted correctly from your settings.

If the Privy code does not appear or is incorrect, please attempt a fresh
install. If your code appears and has been copied and pasted correctly, verify
that it's firing:

  * Open a page on your website and right-click anywhere on the page.
  * In the dropdown menu, select **Inspect Element** or**Inspect**. A toolbar will appear at the bottom or side of your screen.
  * Click the **Network** tab, then refresh your page. 
  * Click the **Name** column to sort the elements alphabetically, then look for widget _.js_. 
  * Next to _widget.js,_ you should see  _304 Not Modified_ or  _200 OK_ in the  _Status_ column.

If you see any other status or the .js code is not found, your tracking code
may not be firing correctly. [Contact Support](mailto:support@privy.com) for
