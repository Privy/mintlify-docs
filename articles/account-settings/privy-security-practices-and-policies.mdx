This article describes Privy's current security practices and policies. If you
believe you've found a vulnerability in one of Privy's services, please see
the [Security](https://privy.com/security) page for responsible disclosure
information.

# Application development

  * Privy regularly deploys new features and improvements multiple times per week. All application code changes must pass multiple forms of human and automated review before deployment.
  * Extensive unit, integration, and static analysis tests are run against all changes before release.
  * Production and development environments are always kept separate on physically distinct networks.

# Software vulnerability patching

  * Many of Privy's software systems are automatically patched and updated on a rolling basis.
  * Privy regularly tests and deploys patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software packages and has an automated alerting system for when new security patches are available.

# Authorization and access control

  * Multi-factor authentication is mandatory for anyone with direct access to Privy's underlying technical infrastructure and customer backups.
  * Customer PII is only accessed on a need-to-know basis, and actions taken in Privy's internal support dashboard are audited.
  * Customer PII is never mixed - each account is segregated so that users can never access another account's customer data.
  * Payment information is stored in a separate organization that is certified PCI Service Provider Level 1, the most stringent certification available.

# Data security and encryption

  * All data is encrypted at rest. Privy uses either a symmetric key encryption algorithm like AES-256-GCM or public-private key encryption with a key size of at least 1024 bits. 
  * All data is encrypted in transit. Privy data is accessible only via TLS, using a minimum of TLS 1.1. It is not possible to access services without HTTPS.
  * Privy.com enforces HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and all subdomains are on the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/?domain=privy.com).
  * The Privy.com domain is signed with [DNSSEC](https://dnssec-analyzer.verisignlabs.com/privy.com).
  * All passwords are salted and hashed with one-way encryption.
  * Application credentials are stored separately from the codebase.

# Data residency

  * All customer data is stored in the continental United States.
  * Privy's content delivery network may serve static assets worldwide but does not store customer data.

# Datacenter security

  * Physical data center security is managed by Amazon Web Services, which has achieved the highest level of certifications, including ISO 27001 and SOC. For more information, see [AWS Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/) and [AWS Compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/).

# Uptime, Reliability, and Recovery

  * Privy constantly monitors its service for performance and availability. When issues are reported, they will appear on the [Status Page](https://status.privy.com/).
  * All application and customer data are stored on redundant infrastructure across multiple availability zones to eliminate single failure points.
  * Customer data is backed up nightly and retained on a rolling basis to recover in the event of a disaster.
