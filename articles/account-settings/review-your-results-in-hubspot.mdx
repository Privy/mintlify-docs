Once you’ve [connected your Privy account with
HubSpot](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/105-install-privy-on-
hubspot), you can see submissions from Privy campaigns in your HubSpot
account. You’ll need to set up an [automation
rule](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/108-use-display-automation-
rules) for each campaign by choosing which list to sync and checking the box
for “double opt-in” enabled.

**Note:** If you capture information beyond an email address, you must also
ensure your form is [mapped to the correct
field](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/123-create-and-use-field-
mapping) in HubSpot. These mappings are case-sensitive.

Once you’ve successfully enabled and launched your campaign, you will be able
to see the results within your Hubspot account in the “Forms” section. By
default, Privy forms will be shown with the campaign number. We recommend
changing the form's name to something more intuitive.

If you click on an individual submission, you can view that submission's
details.

And this submission will show on the contact’s timeline.

This form will also be available in smart lists and workflows within HubSpot
as a trigger event or filtering criteria.
