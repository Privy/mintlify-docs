A unique Privy code must be installed on your BigCommerce store to display
your onsite campaigns, track visitor behavior (e.g., campaign views), and
share other account information. The Privy app for BigCommerce performs this
installation automatically without the need for development skills. If you
would prefer or need to place the code manually, please follow the manual
install method instead.

If you're using a different provider, please review the instructions outlined
in [this guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-
your-site) instead.

# Features of the integration

Installing Privy will not modify your store theme or change any store settings
when installed through the marketplace. Installing the app will enable the
following:

  * The triggering and display of your Privy Convert campaigns (e.g., Popups) on your site
  * The collection of analytics information tied to your site and campaign pageviews
  * The creation and management of unique coupon codes for BigCommerce within Privy
  * An option to export contacts directly from Privy's [contacts dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.com/contacts) to BigCommerce

# Configuration

To install the Privy app for BigCommerce:

  * Visit [Privy's listing](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/privy/?search=shop) in the BigCommerce App Marketplace.
  * Click the **Get This App** button, provide your account credentials, and select the appropriate account if you have more than one associated with your information. 
  * On the app's information page, click the **Install** button. 
  * On the installation page, check the confirmation box and hit **Confirm**.
  * Click **Connect** on the prompt and select a specific Privy account if more than one is detected.

That's it! You'll now see the Linked Accounts section of your Privy account
with BigCommerce listed as an active integration.

# Manual install

It is recommended that most users install the Privy app for BigCommerce
automatically. Please confirm that the standard installation does not fit your
situation before proceeding.

To perform a manual install, you must determine your theme type. BigCommerce
supports two theme engines: Stencil and Blueprint. Stencil is BigCommerce's
latest technology, and all new stores can only access Stencil themes. However,
older stores use the legacy theme engine, Blueprint, which cannot render
scripts inserted through the Script Manager.

Please use the steps and visual examples listed below to determine your
store's current theme engine. The two engines offer distinct menu options and
graphic styles. Due to the number of theme variations and customizations,
specific manual guidance cannot be provided for each theme available to users
of the two theme engines.

## Manual install for Blueprint Themes

To manually install Privy on a BigCommerce store using the Blueprint Theme:

  * Copy your [Privy Code](https://dashboard.privy.com/settings/widget) from your Privy account's settings. 
  * From your BigCommerce dashboard, select Storefront Design. Under Design Options, select the **Themes** tab and then click **HTML/CSS** options. If you haven't made any previous changes to the default theme, you'll need to duplicate it before proceeding.

  * In the new window, find and select the **Header.html** section from the sidebar.

## Manual Install for Stencil Themes

  * From your dashboard in BigCommerce, select **Storefront** > **Script Manager** from the sidebar.

  * Select the **Head** option under the location settings. 
  * Select the**All Pages** option under the page settings.

  * Paste the copied code into the **Script contents** area and **Save**.
