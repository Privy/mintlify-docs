A unique Privy code must be installed on your HubSpot website for your
displays to show and track website events (e.g., display views). If you're
using a different provider, please review the instructions outlined in [this
guide](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-your-site)
instead.

# Copy the code

To install your code, you first need to copy it from your Privy account's
settings:

  * In Privy, click the **Account** option from the navigation. Your business name appears there. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section. 
  * Locate and select the **Default** or **Asynchronous** tab to reveal its details. The default code is the preferred method for installing Privy and will allow it to load in line with everything else on your site. Meanwhile, the asynchronous code will load Privy last. 
  * Copy the selected code.

# Install the code

To install your Privy code onto a HubSpot site:

  * Log in to your [HubSpot](https://app.hubspot.com/login) account.
  * Navigate to **Account Settings** > **Website** > **Pages**. 
  * Locate the **Site Header HTML** area, paste your Privy code there, and **Save**.

# Verify the installation

The Privy code allows you to display your displays and monitor your website's
events (e.g., display views). If your displays aren't displaying properly or
event information is missing, verify that the code has been installed and that
it's firing correctly:

  * Select the **Account** option from the navigation bar in Privy. Your business name appears here. 
  * Select the **Business Information** option from the dropdown menu. 
  * In the sidebar, select **Privy Code** under the  _Business Settings_ section. 
  * In the _Installation Guides_ section, locate and copy your account identifier. 
  * Open a page on your website and right-click anywhere on the page.
  * In the dropdown menu, select **View page source** or **View source**.
  * Use **CTRL-F** or **CMD-F** to search for the identifier that you copied.

  * If the code appears, verify that it has been copied and pasted correctly from your settings.

If the Privy code does not appear or is incorrect, follow the steps again to
install it properly. If your code appears and has been copied and pasted
correctly, verify that it's firing:

  * Open a page on your website and right-click anywhere on the page.
  * In the dropdown menu, select **Inspect Element** or**Inspect**. A toolbar will appear at the bottom or side of your screen.
  * Click the **Network** tab, then refresh your page. 
  * Click the **Name** column to sort the elements alphabetically, then look for widget _.js_. 
  * Next to _widget.js,_ you should see  _304 Not Modified_ or  _200 OK_ in the  _Status_ column.

If you see any other status or the .js code is not found, your tracking code
may not be firing correctly. [Contact Support](mailto:support@privy.com) for
