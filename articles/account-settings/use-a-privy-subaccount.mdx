If you [manage multiple businesses or
brands](https://privy.happyfox.com/kb/article/40-manage-multiple-businesses/)
and would like to use Privy, you may want to create Privy subaccounts for each
of those websites.

# When to use subaccounts

Depending on your situation, a subaccount(s) may or may not suit you.

### You should use subaccounts if:

  * You have multiple stores or sub-brands, and you want a Privy business for each one.
  * You want one consolidated bill from Privy for all the accounts except for Privy Text. 
  * You have a single brand and multiple websitesâ€”for example, country-specific domains or currency-specific versions of your storefront. 
  * You want a staging or test environment for previewing changes before making them on the business connected to your live store. 

### You should not use subaccounts if:

  * You want separate bills for each business. Subaccounts can't be billed separately.
  * You want to run and manage identical displays on multiple sites from one account. Displays can be easily [copied](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/154-duplicate-a-display) to additional accounts, but changes to one copy will not affect the others. Instead, [install the Privy code](https://privy.helpscoutdocs.com/article/73-install-privy-on-your-site) for your second business on that website manually. 
  * You are an agency working on behalf of clients. Agencies should create a new business for each client. Subaccounts can't be billed separately and shouldn't be resold to third parties without prior agreement from Privy. 

# Disclaimers and Limitations

**Features** :

  * Privy Text is not available for subaccounts bundled under parent accounts. To use Privy Text for multiple businesses, you must create multiple unique Privy accounts.
  * If the parent/primary account adds or removes plans or features (e.g., Email), any subaccounts are automatically updated to reflect the parent account's plan. 
  * The following features are not shared or inherited between parent accounts and subaccounts: user permissions, custom sending domains, contacts, coupons, linked accounts (integrations), displays, display templates, email templates, design assets, and photos. 

**Billing & Usage**:

  * Merchants will receive a consolidated bill for all accounts. Subaccounts aren't billed separately. 
  * Privy subaccounts inherit the traffic enforcement state, trial state, and any supported shared features/settings of the parent account. Review the previous section to learn more about which features/settings are not shared between accounts. 
  * Traffic from subaccounts will be "rolled up" to parent accounts for billing purposes.
  * Mailable contacts from subaccounts will be rolled up to the parent account for billing purposes. Contacts are counted each time they appear in a subaccount.
